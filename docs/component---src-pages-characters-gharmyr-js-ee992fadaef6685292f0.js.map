His hair is\n        frizzy, but braided tightly into dreadlocks. Set in his massive, thick\n        skull are his brown eyes affixed forward. Hanging at the bottom of an\n        oblong shaped head is a black goatee connected to a mustache sprouting\n        from underneath a large nose with flared nostrils. A scar upon the bulky\n        right forearm along the vein symbolizes the purity coursing throughout\n        his veins. Distinguishingly enough, this troll's cheeks are of a deep\n        blue aura. Another scar down his left forearm symbolizes a second and\n        more official oath. A dagger is warpainted on the right forearm. Overtop\n        of the scar upon the left forearm, burnt flesh resembles an angry mob\n        with arms raised. It glows a pale yellow light and hums with chants of\n        defiance. Above the warpainted dagger upon the right bicep is a larger\n        and more intimidating warpainted broadsword. Across the length of his\n        shoulder with the point directed towards his neck is a freshly\n        warpainted warhammer that stands out from the other drawings.\n      </p>\n      <Exits>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/inner-keep\">The Inner Keep</Link>\n      </Exits>\n    </Room>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Gharmyr;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
