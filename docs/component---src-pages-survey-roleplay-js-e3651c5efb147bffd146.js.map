So I don't count it. My favorite\r\n          interaction was as Ethimos when he was more-or-less brutalized,\r\n          interrogated, muted and faced potential exile from the Tower. The\r\n          interaction was with Ishq and Nyrisia. Tehain was an awesome drow to\r\n          RP with, too. Tako was a hoot. Isnar- creeper.

RPing with Nyrisia in the lead up to Brethren coming\r\n          back. Favorite though is Nixalis and RPing a talking bracer and\r\n          starting a 'church of the holy bracer' clan before receiving the\r\n          brand.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          The various interactions I had with Brofirir while playing a couple\r\n          different alts were always amusing and fun.
