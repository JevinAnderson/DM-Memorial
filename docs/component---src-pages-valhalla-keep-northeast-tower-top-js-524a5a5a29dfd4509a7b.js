The western wall is filled with a large, beautiful blue curtain of sturdy make. The curtain is bound by large, polished brass rings allowing it to be closed or opened at will. A huge, glass roof covers the top of the Tower. This beautiful roof is held on metal hinges on both sides allowing the roof to be retracted open or closed at will. The glass is perfectly transparent allowing sunlight or moonlight to find the bottom of the floor with ease. Completely encircling the perimeter of the tower floor is a layer of stone, seemingly a second layer to what was once the first (wall) layer, and high enough to require that you step over and onto the tower room floor. That floor is covered with moist soil, thick in mulch, mixed with decaying leaves, through which many plants have sprouted. The trees which grow here are twisted and bent. Parts of them look dead, but new growth has sprouted, and the leaves are a healthy green. Some of the shrubs have also taken a beating, it appears, but they, too, have new greenery to show for their fight against the elements. Near the twisted trees, in the center of the soil-filled floor, off to the side of the worn path, is a construction known as a dakota hole. At the base of the northern wall and the secondary inner wall, a marble pipe emerges upward, and warm water trickles out and soaks the ever moist, mulchy soil. The northern wall appears is perfect shape, even polished of any dirt or blemishes. On the right side of the northern wall there is a remaining tree leaning heavily against the top of the wall, its purchase on the shallow floor iffy. The southern wall has small ivy vines holding grip to the small grooves in the wall, their tiny green leaves seeking sunlight. A small grouping of pink roses appears to have taken root near one of the green shrubs. Near another green shrub a small grouping of yellow tulips grows. A small white lily grows near the base of one of the smaller trees. A huge grouping of bright orange and yellow flowers grows in the eastern section among a few small green shrubs. A small sprig of purple violets grows outside an overturned box and between two green shrubs. tower."),a.a.createElement(i.a,null,a.a.createElement(u.Link,{to:"/valhalla/keep/northeast-tower"},"down")),a.a.createElement(h.a,null,a.a.createElement(u.Link,{to:"/characters/joja"},"(OUTLAW) ",a.a.createElement(c.e,null)," A tall, slim, fair elven lady with enormous wings of fluffy white feathers is here."),a.a.createElement(u.Link,{to:"/characters/krazar"},"A Massive Titan, Surrounded by a Dark Aura"))))}},"RzW+":function(e,t,n){"use strict";var r=n("q1tI"),a=n.n(r),o=n("WGeO"),l=n.n(o);t.a=function(e){var t=e.children;return a.a.createElement("div",{className:l.a.characters},t)}}}]);
