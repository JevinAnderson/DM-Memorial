His long,\n        black, hair streams down his massive shoulders and flows down his back.\n        You notice that his skin is thick and leathery as if the tension of many\n        a battle hath beaten his skin into a calloused armor. Though he does not\n        look as though he is the most intelligent being, he still looks as\n        though he could handle himself in a fight. His legs are as thick as tree\n        trunks. While his arms look to be wrought of V iron. Across his sinewy\n        chest you see a tattoo of ^ an eagle soaring over an enraged viper. You\n        also notice a carved tattoo of a DAGGER on his forearm. Directly above\n        the dagger is a finely etched BROADSWORD that runs the rest of the span\n        of his well muscled arm. On the opposite arm you notice a large\n        WARHAMMER deeply engraved in his calloused flesh As his tunic parts you\n        see that across his broad chest is a well etched BATTLEAXE\n      </p>\n      <Exits>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/northeast-tower-top\">\n          The Top of the Northeast Tower\n        </Link>\n      </Exits>\n    </Room>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Krazar;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
