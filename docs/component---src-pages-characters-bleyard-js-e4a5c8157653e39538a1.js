He stands tall at 13', but he looks like a regular piece of scenery, and doesn't seem too obtrusive. He almost looks like an out of place garden, roaming innocently. Looking more fresh than his weathered skin is a black tattoo, just below his collarbone, laterally across his chest; a flat, long-handled dagger. His right thigh holds the hilt of a large broadsword tattoo that runs to its tip at the bottom of his shin. Over the bumps of fauna and muscle rippling his back, the handle of a Warhammer tattoo stretches up his spine and the maul of the hammer stretches out over his massive right shoulderblade. A menacing looking double-sided BattleAxe is stretched across both his pectorcal muscles, on a slight slant- the handle stretches down into the right part of his hip.",l.a.createElement("br",null),"A horizontal burn mark, a fluorescent green battleaxe, crosses his forehead.
