He is of a race of fabled\n        hunters and warriors known only as the Antfolk to the other sentient\n        races of Thera. This being is apparently male and is rather hostile\n        appearing. His carapace is dull red and seems to be strong armor indeed.\n        He bares strange painted runes on his carapace and his limbs. His head\n        is painted white with the same organic paints. He has large wicked\n        curved and sharp mandibles that slowly click and quiver as he struggles\n        with with the humanoid language of other Therans. His mandibles exude a\n        strange ichor that can only be poison.\n        <br />\n        He has four small round eyes that are bisected and compound and miss\n        nothing. His head slowly rotates from side to side in attempt to watch\n        his surroundings. There appears to be crusted sections of disease on his\n        carapace, as there are entire sections of his carapace that have been\n        weakened with disease. This disease has spread over his upper torso and\n        head leaving him disfigured and maimed. In the center of his head is a\n        symbol burned into the carapace, it is a giant letter \"L\".\n        <br />\n        **Upon the back of his carapace is a tattoo of a long thin DAGGER\n        piercing an Anvil**\n        <br />\n        ***Upon the left side of his carapace is a tattoo of a gleaming\n        BROADSWORD***\n        <br />\n        ****Upon his torso there is a tattoo of a large shining WARHAMMER****\n        <br />\n        *****Upon his abdomen is a tattoo that reads, WARLORD*****\n        <br />\n        ******Upon his head there is a tattoo that reads, LEADER!!!!******\n        <br />\n        --------Upon his face he wears a long red leather veil to cover his\n        face---------\n        <br />\n      </p>\n      <Exits>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/chamber-of-decisions\">\n          The Chamber of Decisions\n        </Link>\n      </Exits>\n    </Room>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Segovax;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
