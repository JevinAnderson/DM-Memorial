Small tufts of fur spring out from the tips of his ears and the edges of his cheeks, and combined with the thick dark eyebrows give him an almost animal quality to his appearance. His almond shaped eyes are blue of color and slightly tilted, his nose is small and delicate as is his mouth. Stubble lines his chin and upper lip, giving him a 5 o'clock shadow. He is fairly thin and wiry, though the look of his clothes tend to suggest he leads a rough and tumble life. A single edged silver dagger, handle bound in cord, is tattooed down his right shoulder. Upon his left shoulder a brilliant red bladed broadsword runs down to his elbow, the handle covered in grey eelskin wrapped with black cloth in triangular patterns. At the nape of his neck is another tattoo, a pair of warhammers crossed forming an x at his neck, one hammer a deep ebony color, the other gleaming ivory."),l.a.createElement(s.a,null,l.a.createElement(h.Link,{to:"/valhalla/keep/northeast-tower"},"The Northeast Tower"))))}}}]);
