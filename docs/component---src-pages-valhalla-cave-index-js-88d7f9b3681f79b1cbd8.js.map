A bizarre structure, the cavern has many\n        chambers of radically different composition. In one you see organized\n        training spaces, a supply master, and a large scoreboard containing\n        names and tallies. In another, gore is strewn everywhere, the ground is\n        sundered and it appears things have burst from the ground, and in the\n        center is a large pool of blood. In yet another chamber, there are\n        ritualistic totems, strange costumes, and various armaments pulsing with\n        a dark aura of taint and corruption. In the center of the cave, an\n        eclectic group of individuals including shamans, vampires, and assassins\n        congregate around Lord Isimsiz as he describes the workings of esoteric\n        rituals to spread darkness, fear, and hate while drawing strength and\n        power from the work.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        In the floor a fiery pit draws your attention.
