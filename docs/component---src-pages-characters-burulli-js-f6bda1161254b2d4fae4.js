He does not seem to care much about his looks. Both his arms are covered by tattoos. Completely encircling the arms in spirals, from shoulders to wrists, are vipers painted in exquisite detail. There is an odd aroma of fresh herbs around him, contradicting with his general looks. Between the coils of the snake on his right arm, you see the tattoo of a dagger, dripping dark poison from its tip. Between the next set of coils, you see the tattoo of a broadsword, coated with crimson poison. Between the next set of coils, you see the tattoo of a spiked warhammer, coated with purple poison.
