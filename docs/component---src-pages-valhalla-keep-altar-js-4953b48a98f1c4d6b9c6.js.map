High above polished\n        granite walls is a nice vaulted ceiling, a dome covered with a mosaic of\n        brilliant colors depicting the life of the First Crusader, a dwarf who\n        gave his life and soul to be housed in the Gauntlet. The walls\n        themselves are so shiny they appear to glow with a luminescence that\n        seems almost alive. Inscribed on the north and south walls are different\n        parts of page sixteen of the Crusader Book of the Code. Covering much of\n        the wall behind the altar is a huge painting depicting a nature scene.\n        The altar itself is fashioned as a pristine block of granite sitting\n        upon a base of marble, with circular stairs leading up to it. Inside the\n        altar lies the War Gauntlet which is guarded day and night by the Wise\n        One. It is rumored that to touch the Gauntlet of War with an impure\n        warrior's soul is to incur the wrath of the gods of war. The floor is\n        also of marble, and it is very clean despite the fact that many booted\n        feet that have trodden upon mud and dirt must enter here at one time or\n        another.\n      </p>\n      <Exits>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/foyer\">west</Link>\n      </Exits>\n      <Spaces />\n      An altar stands here, constructed of granite.\n      <br />A stone statue of a wise warrior stands by the altar.\n      <Characters>\n        <Link to=\"/characters/hutcher\">Hutcher Scar is here.</Link>\n      </Characters>\n    </Room>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Altar;\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport PropTypes from \"prop-types\";\n\nexport class Spaces extends Component {\n  state = Spaces.getDerivedStateFromProps(this.props);\n\n  static getDerivedStateFromProps({ count }) {\n    let content = \"\";\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      content += \"&nbsp;\";\n    }\n\n    return { content };\n  }\n\n  shouldComponentUpdate = nextProps => nextProps.count !== this.props.count;\n\n  render = () => (\n    <span dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: this.state.content }} />\n  );\n}\n\nSpaces.propTypes = {\n  count: PropTypes.number\n};\n\nSpaces.defaultProps = {\n  count: 7\n};\n\nexport default Spaces;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport PropTypes from \"prop-types\";\n\nimport styles from \"./characters.module.css\";\n\nconst Characters = ({ children }) => (\n  <div className={styles.characters}>{children}</div>\n);\n\nCharacters.propTypes = {\n  children: PropTypes.node\n};\n\nexport default Characters;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
