He has a scar on his left cheek, probably an\n        old battle wound which seems to have originated from a slashing weapon.\n        He seems to favor his left leg a bit, but does not seem concerned about\n        it. He has painted himself in strange designs around his body, around\n        these places he has less hair. He has the tattoo of a hammer banging on\n        a shield on his forehead. On his right arm is the tattoo of a\n        well-crafted warhammer with a steel head and a jade adorned hilt.\n      </p>\n      <Exits>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/east-side\">East side of the Keep</Link>\n      </Exits>\n    </Room>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Lazaron;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
