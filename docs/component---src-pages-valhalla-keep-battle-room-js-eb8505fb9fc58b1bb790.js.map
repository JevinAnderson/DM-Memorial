A rack filled with wooden\r\n        practice weapons greets you as you enter. A circular open pit forms a\r\n        battle arena in which the monk and gladiator instruct from. Stains of\r\n        sweat and dried blood lay scattered about the pit and the heavy scent of\r\n        salt hang in the air. Battle charts and graphs of weak points of\r\n        different races line the walls. Dummies, many which seem beaten to a\r\n        pulp, already lie scattered about. This seems to be the perfect place\r\n        for a warrior to build and tone the skills of combat.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <Exits>\r\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/intersection\">south</Link>\r\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/forge\">west</Link>\r\n      </Exits>\r\n      <Link to=\"/characters/oslog\">\r\n        Oslog stands grinning for another round of combat.\r\n      </Link>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <Link to=\"/characters/liming\">\r\n        Liming stands ready to instruct those willing to learn the ways of\r\n        discipline.\r\n      </Link>\r\n    </Room>\r\n  </Layout>\r\n);\r\n\r\nexport default BattleRoom;\r\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
