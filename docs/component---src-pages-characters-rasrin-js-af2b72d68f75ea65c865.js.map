You see a small dagger on each palm, a\n        broadsword on the top of each hand, twin warhammers around each wrist,\n        and battleaxes right above them. On each finger is a letter till they\n        spell the word \"Warlord\", with a small rose on the last finger. As you\n        meet his gaze, you notice he has green eyes that are full of peace.\n      </p>\n      <Exits>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/chamber-of-decisions\">\n          The Chamber of Decisions\n        </Link>\n      </Exits>\n    </Room>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Rasrin;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
