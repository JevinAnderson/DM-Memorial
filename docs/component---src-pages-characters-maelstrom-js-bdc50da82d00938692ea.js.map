Standing 8 feet\n        tall at the shoulders, he is larger than any human you have ever seen.\n        His body is covered with large, compact muscles that ripple fluidly as\n        he moves. He is clad only in a pair of leather breaches that have gone\n        to tatters just above the knees. Dark grey streaks flow across his black\n        skin, calling the image of roiling thunderclouds to your mind. His sad\n        eyes reflect a dim golden glow as he observes his surroundings,\n        smoldering with an inner fire that sets your soul to quaking. Thick\n        wisps of acrid smoke drift upward from his naked torso and bald head,\n        causing your eyes to water. His broad shoulders are stooped, as though\n        under a great weight, and his once proud face has taken on an expression\n        of great sorrow.\n      </p>\n      <Exits>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/forge\">The Crusader Forge</Link>\n      </Exits>\n    </Room>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Maelstrom;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
