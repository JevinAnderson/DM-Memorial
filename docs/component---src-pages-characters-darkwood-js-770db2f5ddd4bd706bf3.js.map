This giant's skin seems to be made of copper\n        or bronze, and looks to be tough as a solid mass of stone. A strong gust\n        of wind blows foilage up from him,sending bits of it swirlling around\n        him like a mini cyclone. Large blood vessels buldge from his massive\n        body, the power to move mountains lie in his arms. Your attention is\n        then drawn to his right forearm, where a colorful tattoo beckons further\n        inspection. A life size picture of a stunningly beautiful grey-elf woman\n        graces his flesh. Scars from many battles fought against the evil magics\n        of mortal hands line his body. As you scan upwards, peering far up this\n        warrior's frame you stare in shock at the horrible sight. A frightening\n        piece of iron is forged into a iron mask that hides most of a shredded\n        face that once brought smiles. Piercing green eyes peer out behind the\n        metal. They seem to stare within your soul, their dazzling green color\n        seem to bring a sense of wild fury yet tranquility. Darkwood takes on\n        the command of the Crusades, leading a group of honorbound warriors to\n        vanquish all mortal magics from the lands of Thera. He searches the\n        realm for those great enough to serve his cause. Those that display\n        honor and true courage in battle will fight along with him until the\n        end.\n      </p>\n      <Exits>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/green-room\">The Green Room</Link>\n      </Exits>\n    </Room>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Darkwood;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
