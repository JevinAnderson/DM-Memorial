His thick red hair has streaks of grey and is tangled\n        and knotted, it is covered with a large black helmet. His clear bright\n        blue eyes have the look of many years of life of wisdom and battle. His\n        broad nose is scarred and bent slightly to the right. Underneath his\n        nose is a moustache that is the same color of his hair though the grey\n        is more evident and profound. The moustache goes down to his chin where\n        it is braided into three different long braids that are held together\n        with small bits of leather string. His face is solemn with a\n        concentrated look of determination. Very large broad shoulders hold his\n        soot smeared armor and is covered with large dents and deep scratches. A\n        large tattoo of a flaming hammer is on the left side of his neck. Around\n        his waist is a black leather belt that holds his array of weaponry that\n        he uses at his disposal. A gleaming battleaxe with a spike at the end of\n        it and a large heavy looking spiked mace. Below his belt are some crude\n        looking leggings tattered from long use. His body is slightly\n        disproportionate to the rest of his body, his torso being larger than\n        his short stubby legs. Deep lines and wrinkles of old age crease his\n        face, he has a tired look in his eyes and his face solemn he looks to\n        have had many years of life and battles, though none the less a fearsome\n        looking warrior.\n        <br />\n        On his left bicep is a slightly faded tattoo of a Dagger with the word\n        'Honor'. His right bicep holds a tattoo slightly faded tattoo as well, a\n        Broadsword named 'Courage'. Starting on his right hand and traveling up\n        his forearm is a might WarHammer wreathed in black flames. A perfectly\n        colored and detailed tattoo of a double-bladed BattleAxe, shining steel\n        with a handle of mithril intertwined with gold. On his back is a rather\n        large tattoo of a severed spine with skull attached of a Magi. His left\n        cheek is a Battleaxe that glows a bright emerald green and occasionally\n        flares brightly. On the skin above his heart is a tattoo of a fiery\n        dragon with the letter \"C\", almost attached to it is another tattoo, a\n        bleeding heart gripped tightly by a hand.\n      </p>\n      <Exits>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/chamber-of-decisions\">\n          The Chamber of Decisions\n        </Link>\n      </Exits>\n    </Room>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Rigahi;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
