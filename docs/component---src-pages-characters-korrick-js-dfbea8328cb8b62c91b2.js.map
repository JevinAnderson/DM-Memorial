His dark face\n        is marred from a life of battle and time spent in the elements. Age\n        lines become visible on his forehead when he squints his eyes. His eyes\n        a cold green that burn with an intensity that could pierce even the\n        thickest of foliage. Even with crows feet forming at the corner of his\n        eyes. His intellect still shines brightly behind those eyes. His nose is\n        slightly bent were it has been broken and reset many times. His lips\n        conceal a set of straight teeth that have been well cared for over the\n        years. His rather impressive torso is covered only in simple white\n        tunic. The tunic is flawless black with a crimson cross surrounded by a\n        thick circle of the same shade. His arms move with a grace and strength\n        that suggests this beast knows how to use those blades he holds. Upon\n        his right hand this creature bears burnt flesh in the shape of a\n        Lantern. Below his torso begins the body of a stallion. A fine white\n        steed by the looks of things. His pale fur is silky and soft to the\n        touch. A fine glow that once came from the sheen of the fur, has begun\n        to fade with time. A slight sway can be seen in his spine, but make no\n        mistake this magnificent animal is thoroughbred. A silver streak\n        radiates in the passing shadows. This alien marking seems very strange,\n        as it appears to have fallen upon this beast's back from the heavens. A\n        slight coil of smoke can be seen entwining with this strange liquid.\n        Surprisingly white and very clean hooves keep this creature mobile.\n        Above them, powerful legs move with great agility. On his left arm is\n        the fine art work of Kug. On his left bicep is a well crafted DAGGER\n        with its blade extending down toward his elbow. A golden blade is the\n        first thing you notice, a pale gold almost as though it were sick. The\n        solid oak handle is inlaid with the word Honor. Upon the blade in silver\n        is the word BROADSWORD. A ray of light breaking through the dark clouds.\n        A brilliant corona surrounds a silver master piece of warfare, Behind\n        the blinding light rest a devastating WARHAMMER. Inscribed on the handle\n        is the words 'Faith'. A quiet meadow spreads out before you. A large\n        army stands ready. In the front bearing a Banner of the Clan is the\n        LEADER. What is this? Pink and blue ribbons have been braided into his\n        tail. His tail of twinkling fear flicks in a swirl of color behind him.\n      </p>\n      <Exits>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/chamber-of-decisions\">\n          The Chamber of Decisions\n        </Link>\n      </Exits>\n    </Room>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Korrick;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
