He has shaggy dirty blonde hair his skin is tanned and wind worn from roughing it in the outdoors a lot. His eyes which are a smokey blue are piercing in their gaze and there is a scar that runs from above his right eyebrow straight down over his right eye down to his jaw line. His shoulders and chest are broader than most of his race and even though he is muscular his muscles are well defined, each defined line of his muscles seemingly cut into his skin. He wears minimal clothing to allow greater movement, and he walks with a grace most would kill or die for. On the back of his hands are twin tattoos of Cranes colored in with black and green. Along the inner forearm of his left arm is a bloody dagger with a hilt wrapped in green leather. Going down his rigt arm is a broadsword outlined in green with a brow n leather handle. Traveling up his left arm from the elbow up is a massive tattoo of a Warhammer with the head of the Warhammer resting on his bulging bicep. The Warhammer itself tinted green with a brown leather handle has "glowing" runes upon the haft and Warhammer head. The ones on the haft read Battle and Natural Order and the runes on the head read Honor. A tattoo of a Battleaxe is on his back, the butterfly blades spreading across his back over his shoulder blades. The top points of the butterfly blades reach his shoulders, the Battleaxe tattoo is colored in with a light blue steel color on the blades, the haft of the Battleaxe colored in with green. The handle of the Battleaxe is colored in with black, having the appearance of black leather wrapped around the haft of the Battleaxe creating the handle itself. The edges of the butterfly blades are dipped in red, giving the appearance of blood on the blades. There is a tattoo of blue, reading ENVOY scrolling over the right side of his neck in flowing script taking up most of the right side of his neck.'),o.a.createElement(l.a,null,o.a.createElement(s.Link,{to:"/valhalla/keep/library"},"Library of the Crusades"))))}}}]);
