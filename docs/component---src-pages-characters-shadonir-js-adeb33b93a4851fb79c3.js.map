They are dark, muddy, and\n        crudely built but at the same time seem flexible and usable. The armor\n        is light on this creature as it is encased in a hard exoskeleton. The\n        surface of this hero is brick red, thick, and adorned with sharp hairs.\n        It wears the bulk of armaments around its torso. A heavy mithril clad\n        vest lays over it's abdomen, with two holes for arms that protrude. It\n        wields a frightening staff in its forehand as well as a well sharpened\n        dagger that seems well polished in its offhand. A elegantly drawn tattoo\n        of a dagger goes up the left side of his neck. On the right side is an\n        elegantly drawn ancient broadsword tattoo.\n      </p>\n      <Exits>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/northwest-tower\">The Northwest Tower</Link>\n      </Exits>\n    </Room>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Shadonir;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
