He stands near 10 hands high, and\n        seems to be just just as wide. He stands on two trunk-like legs that are\n        spread wide to give him the balance he needs to wield his massive axe.\n        He has a long flowing red beard that drapes down to his huge belt\n        buckle. His huge arms bulge with thick corded muscle as he hefts his axe\n        to his shoulder where it rests ready for use. His face is grizzled and\n        weathered from years in the tunnels of the under dark. Where his left\n        eye is supposed to be there is a bolted steel plate that covers the\n        socket that is now empty from some long ago battle, the scare still\n        mares his left half of his face from chin to forehead. The right side of\n        his face is covered in small Dwarven runes, they are tattooed is black\n        ink. The tattoos end at the bridge of his nose, where his weathered face\n        is void of all tattoos.\n        <br />\n        ** Upon his left hand there is a tatoo of a Dagger wreathed in flames,\n        dripping blood.**\n        <br />\n        *Upon his left shoulder is a tattoo of a gleaming BROADSWORD wreathed in\n        dancing lightning*\n        <br />\n        *Upon his left forearm there is a tattoo of a heavy headed WARHAMMER, it\n        is draped is a red tapestry.*\n        <br />\n        ** Upon his neck there is a tattoo that reads WARLORD, it is in red\n        ink.**\n      </p>\n      <Exits>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/armory\">The Armory</Link>\n      </Exits>\n    </Room>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Osric;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
