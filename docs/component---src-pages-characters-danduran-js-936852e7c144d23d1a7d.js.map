His face is covered in a very\n        scruffy beard. His body is covered by robes and some armorments, though\n        his toned definition can be seen upon his exposed legs. His large hands\n        bear no weapon, though there is a slight glow to his fists. A tattoo of\n        a DAGGER can be seen upon his right forearm. Above the dagger tattoo a\n        slightly larger BROADSWORD tattoo can be seen. Upon his inner right\n        forearm is a large WARHAMMER tattoo. Upon the top of his right arm,\n        beautifully scripted is the word ENVOY. Upon his left inner arm is a\n        large gray shield. Upon the shield is an Anvil wreathed with blue-white\n        flames. Below the Anvil in large leaders is the word \"LEADER\".\n      </p>\n      <Exits>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/chamber-of-decisions\">\n          The Chamber of Decisions\n        </Link>\n      </Exits>\n    </Room>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Danduran;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
