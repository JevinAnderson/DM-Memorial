His long white hair, though tied back with a leather strap, drapes like a curtain across his back. The pure white color of his hair could only have come from long hours within the sun leaching out all other color. His dark face is cracked and withered from time spent in the elements. Cold blue eyes chill you as they pierce even the thickest of foliage. His nose is bent right hard were it has been broken and poorly set. His lips may appear damp, perhaps from a recent drink, but they cracked and split in may places. His rather impressive torso is covered only in what little armor he has scavenged thus far. Wickedly strong arms move with a grace that suggest this beast knows how to swift. Below his torso begins the body of a horse. A fine black stallion by the looks of things. His ebony fur is silky and soft to the touch. A fine glow comes of from the sheen of the fur. This suggest he is from good breeding. Just a hint of slight sway in his spine, but this magnificent animal is thoroughbred. Surprisingly white and very clean hooves keep this creature firmly attached to the ground. Above them powerfully quick legs makes it so this beast could dance around any in his way. On his left arm is the fine art work of Kug. On his left bicep is a well crafted dagger with its blade extending down toward his elbow. Kug\'s hand has rendered a beautiful Broadsword. The hilt begins on his left forearm. The finely crafted blade extends down his arm ending at a point on his left palm. Whats this? A cute little kitten, with a fierce snarl, two-hand wielding a massive Warhammer has been etched upon his right bicep. On his inner right forearm you see a bunch of beautiful butterflies covered in glitter and pixie dust. In the meadow giving chase to these fiendish beasts is a giant wearing a red cape wielding a massive BATTLEAXE. In a fervor of a zealot the giant shouts "Me Smush Da Magic!"'),s.a.createElement(h.a,null,s.a.createElement(l.Link,{to:"/valhalla/keep/large-barracks"},"A large Crusader Barracks"))))}}}]);
