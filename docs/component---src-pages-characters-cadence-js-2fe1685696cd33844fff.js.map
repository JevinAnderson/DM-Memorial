She has emerald green eyes\n        that seem aware and alert. Red hair is brushed back into two simple\n        pony-tails that hang loosely on either side of her neck. Long bangs flow\n        down to the collar of a simple off-white linen robe. Engraved on her\n        right cheek is a large battleaxe that appears alive in all its glory. On\n        occasion, it hums and omits a green aura about her. Soft light blue\n        leggings caress down her legs to woven sandals which encompass her small\n        feet. Trickling up her partially clothed arms are large scars that\n        appear to have been formed by large talons slicing at her skin. Her\n        hands look well worn, but in particular her left index finger bears a\n        large blackened scar.\n        <br />\n        An intricate tattoo of a dagger drawn of black ink resides on her left\n        forearm. Around the dagger in red ink resides a large broadsword. Within\n        the two tattoos remains a large \"R\". Along her right forarm, a large\n        scar forms the handle of a wide Warhammer. Upon her left cheek is a\n        battleaxe that mimics the one on her right cheek, though it appears less\n        life-like.\n      </p>\n      <Exits>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/moderate-barracks\">\n          A moderate Crusader barracks\n        </Link>\n      </Exits>\n    </Room>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Cadence;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
