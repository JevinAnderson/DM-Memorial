Bright, vibrantly green eyes are deep set within his skull, and are framed by heavy cheekbones. An apron is worn on his chest, created by several different materials. His left hand holds a rather large, iron hammer, wielding it with ease to do his workmanship. Tattooed on the surface of his left bicep is a Broadsword, crossed by a hammer.
