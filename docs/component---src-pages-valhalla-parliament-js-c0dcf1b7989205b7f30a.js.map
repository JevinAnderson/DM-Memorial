They commend each other on their noble work, and bask in the\r\n        quiet order they had sought to create in their mortal lives. Lord\r\n        Wervdon commends his officers for protecting the innocent and helpless\r\n        every chance he gets. Lord Kaleb can be overheard occasionally arguing\r\n        with Xathen. In one exchange he can be heard to say, \"Look, I told you,\r\n        you don't need the sentient sword here alright. The laws enforce\r\n        themselves in this place.\" He looks on in exasperation as Xathen\r\n        replies, \"I just feel more comfortable with it ok. It's mine!\". At which\r\n        point the sword chimes in with, \"I thirst for blood master!\" He throws\r\n        up his hands in defeat, \"I KNOW, I've heard it before alright!
