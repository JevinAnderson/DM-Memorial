It doesn't flow,\n        but is form fitting, showing his defined muscular figure. His hair is\n        braided and flows freely, the beads at the end brush against each other.\n        The belt of his guild adorns his waist and the family insignia, a large\n        green rain drop, is embroidered onto the back of his black robe. A green\n        tattoo runs down his tan face from the top of his forehead, down through\n        his left eye, stopping at the middle of chin. On the right side of his\n        neck, you see a small dagger engraved, and glowing the same dark green\n        as the tattoo on his face. Surround- ing this dagger, is a broadsword of\n        great size, which signifies his rank in the eternal crusades. His hands\n        are tightly weaved with the strength of Nature, vines and leaves wrapped\n        so closely that they become one with his fists, strengthening his blows.\n        Dominating the back of his neck, the mark of Lord Darkwood, the living\n        battleaxe, glows brightly.\n      </p>\n      <Exits>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/battle-room\">The Banquet Hall</Link>\n      </Exits>\n    </Room>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Hibernai;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
