A strange wooden altar is\n        built to honor true nature. A sense of purity with the land is felt\n        while one is near the altar. On either side of the altar are natural\n        wooden tables, as though they grew as such, their legs rooted into the\n        ground. Upon those tables are small potted oak trees, bonsai of great\n        age and beauty. Their leaves are tiny replicas of full-sized oak leaves,\n        golden in color.\n      </p>\n      <Exits>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/green-room\">north</Link>\n      </Exits>\n      <Spaces />\n      An altar to nature is here, made of living wood.\n      <br />\n      A cricket slowly moves across the floor.\n      <br />\n      A cricket slowly moves across the floor.\n      <br />\n      A cricket slowly moves across the floor.\n      <br />\n      <Link to=\"/characters/druid-of-darkwood\">\n        A tall giant in a green robe silently stands here, observing everything.\n      </Link>\n      <br />\n    </Room>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default ModerateBarracks;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
