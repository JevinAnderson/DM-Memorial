He is roughly 14 feet in height and\n        his weight cannot be judged. His thick body is tight with bulging\n        muscle. His arms, chest and legs ripple with the product of years of\n        hard work. His face is long and tired looking. His face adorns a long\n        jagged scar that goes from his left eyebrow across his nose and down\n        into is long, brown beard. His eyes a deep bark coloured brown that\n        match his beard and hair almost perfectly. His hair is long, shoulder\n        length and like his beard it is a brown, however significantly lighter,\n        perhaps lightened some from many hours in the hot Theran suns. His left\n        forearm adorns a very long, and distinct tattoo of a two crossed battle\n        staffs with the inscription \"Purification Through Blood.\" Upon his left\n        is a deep brand of of the Living Battleaxe that appears to emit a slight\n        green aura. Below his right elbow, is a very distinct mark of a small\n        dagger. Upon his left arm is another visible tattoo, this one is of a\n        large broadsword. Across his massive chest is another dark tattoo, this\n        of a massive warhammer with the inscription of \"Purity and Honor\"\n        underneath. Across his massive back is another large tattoo of a shaded\n        battleaxe entangled in thorny vines. Upon the blade of the axe are the\n        words \"Death before Dishonor\"\n      </p>\n      <Exits>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/foyer\">Foyer to the Altar Room</Link>\n      </Exits>\n    </Room>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Gelador;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
