Its limbs are long and robust,\n        its paws are average in size. His head is very heavy looking and large,\n        sitting at a parallel level to his back. His muzzle and jaw is long and\n        very strong, sharp bone crushing canine teeth are visible as he pants.\n        His triangular shaped ears point upwards at the top of his head, both\n        scarred from years of travel and battle. His neck is visibly muscular\n        and a shaved area is visible between his front shoulder blades. You\n        notice a masterfully designed and inked tattoo upon in the shape of a\n        large shield. The shield is small at the bottom and larger at the top\n        containing six different sections. At the bottom of the shield in small\n        but legible print is the word DAGGER. Above that is the word BROADSWORD\n        in slightly larger print. Continuing up comes WARHAMMER, BATTLEAXE,\n        ENVOY and finally LEADER at the top. Each word slightly larger then the\n        previous. Vines, flowers, raindrops, and creatures are all designed in\n        and around the words, a masterpiece of a tattoo. A daggers handle and\n        hilt is seen right above the top word and the blade pierces down through\n        the rest as if it joins all the words together in a ranking system. The\n        tattoo looks to have taken hours to craft and has not seemed to fade\n        even as the creature grew older. The rest of his fur looks to be black\n        but is beginning to gray from aging.\n      </p>\n      <Exits>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/chamber-of-decisions\">\n          The Chamber of Decisions\n        </Link>\n      </Exits>\n    </Room>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Skean;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
