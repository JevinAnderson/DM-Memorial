Thousands of people sit around tables set throughout the room. Here is where those who never joined a great house congregate. Not all adventurers are created equal, and many never had the skills needed to serve. Some wished not to be bound to the strict rules of those houses. For instance, members of the notorious clan Dominion have their own table now. For their acts in life one might assume animosity from others here, but none exists. What deeds came before don't matter now. Perspective here is crystal clear. Stories are told, songs are sung, poetry recited, and the memories remain. For all the bad, there was a lot more fun. Dungeons were crawled, formulas were learned, dragons were slain, and time was wasted beautifully. At the head of the hall, many of the greatest divinities sit at their own table. Occasionally they are approached, and are friendly with the mortals they have looked over for so long. Nyrisia sits smirking while listening to boisterous tales from the past.
