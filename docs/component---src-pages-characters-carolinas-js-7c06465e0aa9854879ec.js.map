His body\n        is composed with layers of hard muscle; enormous veins budge out across\n        the tanned and blemished skin. The chin is kept clean -- yet rough with\n        small growth. A scar starts at the farthest end of the large left\n        eyebrow and travels up the temple to where it disappears into the unruly\n        mass of short- cropped, blonde curls. Bright, vibrantly green eyes are\n        deep set within his skull, and are framed by heavy cheekbones. An apron\n        is worn on his chest, created by several different materials. His left\n        hand holds a rather large, iron hammer, wielding it with ease to do his\n        workmanship. Tattooed on the surface of his left bicep is a Broadsword,\n        crossed by a hammer. Surrounding the pictures are tiny burn marks.\n      </p>\n      <Exits>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/forge\">The Crusader Forge</Link>\n      </Exits>\n    </Room>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Carolinas;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
