A small braid dangles from the side of his short brown hair. His frame shows power, but is more lithe than muscular. His eyes seem to shine with a determined vigor from inside their sockets. His face shows the remains of fading scars and scrapes through it's slightly pale skin, though few look to have occurred recently. His chin and jaw are lined with a dark trim of facial hair, seemingly kept trim and groomed. His exposed limbs are sinewy, suggesting a natural grace, and the placement of muscle suggests a man who has been working with his hands a lot.",o.a.createElement("br",null),"Under any armor worn, the man wears simple clothing. Nothing to suggest aristocracy or anything of that nature, nor anything that looks particularly encumbering. Hanging from his neck you can see a small charm, though closer inspection reveals it is actually merely a piece of a charm, cracked and faded to the point of being impossible to discern any design from.",o.a.createElement("br",null),"On his upper right arm sits a tattoo of a DAGGER with a wavy blade, drawn in black ink. The hilt of the dagger resembles the scales of a dragon. The dagger sits on a slant. Crossing the dagger, in a similar style, rests a BROADSWORD. Vertically over the two blades sits a large WARHAMMER. The handle of the warhammer crosses, but is visibly above the two blades, while the slightly curved head of the hammer sits to the left of the blades. Coming down in the middle of the three tattoos rests a BATTLEAXE. The blade of the axe sits atop the tattoo, slightly above the lines of the two hilts. The middle of the axe handle crosses the middle of the hammer, nearly perfectly. The tattoo is framed by two large wings, connected by a rolled scroll lying below the tattoo. Across the scroll, the word ENVOY is printed. The tattoo seems important, as if a symbol of rank."),o.a.createElement(i.a,null,o.a.createElement(h.Link,{to:"/valhalla/keep/southeast-tower"},"The Southeast Tower"))))}}}]);
