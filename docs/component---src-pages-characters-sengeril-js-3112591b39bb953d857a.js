Sengeril appears to be of trollish descent at first glance. His skin is a flawless ebony-green. His pointed ears and narrow bone structure in his face gives him a very Elvin look. Unlike most trolls who are incredibly large built masses of meat and muscle. Sengeril's muscle is incredibly lean. His muscle and sinew look almost unnatural, as if sculpted from solid rock. Long snow white hair flows down onto his shoulders with the exceptions of a small red line. A dull glow radiatese from his puiless blood red eyees. making it impossible to ascertain where they focus. His armour is crafted of fine mithril embroidered with many symbols of the royal family Dhaes Drae Aesilon. A blood red cape of a fine silk like material hangs down from his neck, moving in the wind. Sengeril's movements are as fluid as his cape upon the wind. A large sword is strapped over his shoulder that is covered in a thin layer of Blood.
