The\n        gigantic iron gates which lock the outer keep are swung wide open. The\n        hardened stone walls of the castle loom about three to four stories.\n        Battle runes and mottos are inscribed within the front stone walls. From\n        this spot four large towers can be seen jutting out of the four corners\n        of the castle. On each tower a Crusader banner whips in the winds. The\n        stone blocks forming the thick structure of the outer castle gleam white\n        in either sunlight or moonlight.
