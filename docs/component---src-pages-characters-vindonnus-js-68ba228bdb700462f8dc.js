His skin is dark green, reminding one of the colour of an evergreen. Black hair grows on top of his head, on closer inspection his hair appears to look more like moss. His face is clean shaven, with a scar of singed flesh jutting down from his right temple to the edge of his jaw. Sapphire eyes look out at the realms, filled with a sense of resolve and conviction. Arching over his eyes are black eyebrows, they too seem to be a moss-like. Hanging around his muscular neck is a medallion imprinted with the signature of the BloodKnights of Steel. Massive arms hang to his sides, both appearing very muscular. A dagger tattoo is on his left forearm, the hilt starts just above his wrist and the tip points upward to his bicep. The dagger is seven inches long. The hilt has a swirled design, mixing ivory white with deep-red. The blade itself is very slender and tinted a steely blue. A broadsword tattoo is on his right forearm. The hilt of the broadsword starts at his wrist, the tip of the blade reaches to his elbow. A dark-brown leather wrapping with a webbed design is what you see on the hilt. Written in red ink the words “Honour” and “Battle” are on each side of the blade; the blade itself is a steely blue colour. His torso is massive, very well-defined muscle. When you catch a glimpse of his back, you see well-defined muscles, but you also take note of a tattoo. A War hammer is tattooed on the width of his back, the handle beginning on his left shoulder, and the double-sided hammerhead on his right. The handle is colored a dark-brown, with the grains of the wood in the design. The hammerhead itself, is large, and steely-grey in colour; scribed onto the head in red ink are the words “Natural Order”. Tree-trunk legs carry this man, his feet planted firmly into the ground."),o.a.createElement(h.a,null,o.a.createElement(l.Link,{to:"/valhalla/keep"},"The Keep"))))}}}]);
