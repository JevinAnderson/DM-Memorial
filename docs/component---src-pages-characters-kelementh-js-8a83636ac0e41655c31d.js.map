The bits of armor you can see under his over emcompasing cloak,\n        are made of well fitted leather and cloth, almost to promote movement.\n        The small bits of skin you can see, seems to be made of rough leather,\n        with bits of crimson scales flaking off. On his back you can see a small\n        bag, made of dark leather and bits of cloth. This bag seems to be filled\n        with small odds and ends he might need. A flash of sapphire blue can\n        been seen on his right fore-arm. Uppon inspection you see images\n        tattoo'd into his scales. The largest image is a cresent bladed dagger.\n        On his left arm, on the inner portain, you see a single bladed\n        broadsword in the most brilliant sapphire blue. Across his knuckles you\n        see, a large blue warhammer, outlined in emerald green. Starting at his\n        ineer wrist and wrapping around the cresant bladed dagger, is the word\n        Warlord in deep sapphire blue.\n      </p>\n      <Exits>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/northwest-tower-top\">The Northwest Tower</Link>\n      </Exits>\n    </Room>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Kelemeth;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
