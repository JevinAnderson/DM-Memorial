With his long silver hair hanging to his shoulders,\r\n        his face is not unattractive. And his lavender eyes illuminate his sharp\r\n        features. His build is slender, but strong, and he walks with a sort of\r\n        grace, like that of a dancer. There is a certain alertness to him as\r\n        well, he seems to be looking, if not seeing, everything. His gaze sweeps\r\n        around his surroundings looking for any sign of trouble. He dresses\r\n        lightly and in dark clothing. Preferring black cloaks to more blend into\r\n        the shadows. And he wears his cloak well enough to conceal his weapons\r\n        and armor, so that he has a more casual look so as not to draw unwanted\r\n        attention. And in his profession, any attention is unwanted.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <Exits>\r\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/casino\">The Casino</Link>\r\n      </Exits>\r\n    </Room>\r\n  </Layout>\r\n);\r\n\r\nexport default Splythe;\r\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
