His flesh seems to wrap his\n        bones. His hair is a thin brown, and is very dirty. His eyelids are thin\n        and his sad looking eyes bulge from his skull. They shimmer a forest\n        green, which have a shine to them from tears which are always there. His\n        age-lined face is dirty and crusty from dried tears. His teeth are\n        rotten and black, and he is missing several of them. He has one huge,\n        jagged tooth behind his upper lip. His arms are pale, skinny, and\n        smooth, wielding barely any strength. On his hands, he wears tight\n        gloves, made of the skin of a gnome. The shirt he wears is torn and\n        tattered. Many colored patches are sewn into it to hold it together. His\n        pants are the same way. Worn on his feet are watertight bags, with a bit\n        of sponge on the bottom. On his head, he wears an ornate pirate hat, a\n        picture of a skull and crossbones on it. On his right shoulder rests his\n        piratey parrot, Chuck, whose colours look very weird, almost a grayish\n        mixed with green. A small cut in his left cheek, still remotely open,\n        drips a reddish green. He carries a sack, on which he has a words\n        stitched onto it that read: 'He has bricks in his sack, which he slings\n        o'er his back.' As for his back, you see through the tatters of his\n        shirt that his back was used as a canvas for a tattoo artist, perhaps\n        more than one, for the styles of the various elements are different. You\n        see what appears to be a sailboat with many sails, and at the top of the\n        mast, a blue pirate's hat. Superimposed over the sail- boat is a huge\n        dagger. Across that huge dagger is a broadsword, and crossing the\n        broadsword is a warhammer.\n      </p>\n      <Exits>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/bar\">The Crusader Bar</Link>\n      </Exits>\n    </Room>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Femin;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
