Immediately you can see that age has taken a toll on this man. His once blonde hair has turned white with time. His cold blue eyes still have that sharp, keen look to them, but they are covered with eyelids that sag and droop and fall beneath a forehead permanently creased. Hutcher's once pointed nose has been smashed and flattened from continual battles over the years. His face, while always his namesake, has gained a few more scars since his induction in the clan. His oldest scars remain. A scar in the center of his hairline is an inch in length and runs halfway into his hair, and halfway onto his forehead. This scar is only noticeable when his hair is at its shortest. On the lower left portion of his lip is a second scar smaller in size. In addition to these scars, many newer marks adorn his face. A scar on his right cheek for instance, indicates a time when a dagger was thrust through his cheek and some poorly improvised stitching was used to close the wound. A strong punch to his mouth put his own teeth through his lip and created a scar that runs from his right nostril to the left side of his lip. These are but a few of the noticeable scars you see when looking at this man. When Hutcher's right forearm is visible, you notice the tattoo of a dagger. This tattoo, obviously his oldest, has lost ink and faded over the years. Upon his left forearm is a nasty scar that has been noticeably worked into the tattoo of a broadsword. While such work may once have been commendable, time has accentuated this makeshift job showing it for what it was, an obvious improvisation. On the bicep of his right arm is another nasty scar, it has been worked into a warhammer by Kug's able hands. Upon his right wrist is an elaborately designed Battleaxe tattoo which covers a mark that may have once been a burn. When uncovered, his chest reveals the mural tattooed upon it. This mural depicts an elaborate battle between the Conclave of Wizardry and the Steel Clan. Charging gloriously into the assault is the Leader of the Steel Clan in full battle armor. He hefts a spear aimed at the Conclave Leader's head. Flanking him on his right and left sides are Warlords of the Steel Clan. They engage the Archwizards of the Conclave with sword and axe. Behind these three lie a trail of fallen magi. Then, off to the side, you see a man hunched uncomfortably over a desk. This man sits with a pained expression as he fills out scrolls and listens to the young man beside him say, \"Can I be in the Steel Clan?\" An arrow points to this pitiful figure with the words, \"I'm that guy,\" etched beside it. This tattoo illustrates Hutcher's current rank as Envoy of the Crusades."),n.a.createElement(r.a,null,n.a.createElement(l.Link,{to:"/valhalla/keep/altar"},"The Altar of The Never Ending Crusades"))))}}}]);
