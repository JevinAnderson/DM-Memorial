He is not extraordinarily large,\n        however his entire body is well defined and fine-tune from years of\n        dedication to his training. You can only describe the movement of his\n        arms as swift and deadly, true in the style of the Tiger. A droplet of\n        sweat is apparent on his forehead, he has obviously just stepped away\n        from his dojo to meet with you. Like all other monks, Tanzer shares the\n        common goal of maintaining the perfect balance between both the physical\n        and mental attributes of the body and soul. He keeps his spirit strong.\n        Branded into his forearm is the dagger of the Steel.\n      </p>\n      <Exits>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/further\">Further in the Keep</Link>\n      </Exits>\n    </Room>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Tanzer;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
