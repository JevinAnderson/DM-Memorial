This defender needs not be at the Guardian, merely in\r\n        the lands. In respect to conclave apprentices - it is their duty to\r\n        expect such a raid when a crusader is present. The Crusader may notify\r\n        the apprentice, but is not required to do so.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Exception to above - it is permissible to raid without mortal defender\r\n        to balance the power advantage.
