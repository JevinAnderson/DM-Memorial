Fastolph - He double backstabbed me in his\n          shrine, thinking that I'd survive the hits, I didn't. Valgaav - Taught\n          me to be actually Lawful Good (Lifer Paladin, human). Bonus, people I\n          didn't like: Chris M. from Detroit was an actual IRL friend that got\n          the entirety of Michigan sitebanned because of social engineering, and\n          gaining actual admin access to MOST of dm's Pfiles.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Drintazt.
