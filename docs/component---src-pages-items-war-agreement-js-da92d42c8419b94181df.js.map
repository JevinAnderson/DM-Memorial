This defender needs not be at the Guardian, merely in\n        the lands. In respect to conclave apprentices - it is their duty to\n        expect such a raid when a crusader is present. The Crusader may notify\n        the apprentice, but is not required to do so.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Exception to above - it is permissible to raid without mortal defender\n        to balance the power advantage. To win by Absence is not an honorable or\n        acceptable war strategy.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Duels can be offered and should be offered. If they are refused then\n        either side may regain their respective artifact by attack and raid.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        if a raid is started while a mortal defender is in the lands and said\n        defender departs the raid is to be completed and the item of power may\n        be taken.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        During the war period only to ensure these terms are being met when\n        there is a raid a scroll is to be sent to EACH house stating who\n        attacked and who was in the realms to defend.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The above is the official agreement as prepared by Wojciecha of House\n        Crusader and Quenton of House Conclave.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Sealed: <br />\n        Wojciecha, Leader of the Neverending Crusader\n        <br />\n        Quenton, Master of the Tower\n      </p>\n      <p>1st the Month of the Winter Wolf, Year 215</p>\n      <p>Amendment</p>\n      <p>To: Crusader and Conclave</p>\n      <p>\n        The treaty is once again back in place between our houses. There are\n        amendments to adress and so we do so now. There will be NO defenderless\n        raids on the houses. This will make the battles in the weeks between the\n        times of combat worth gaining.
