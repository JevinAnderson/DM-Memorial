She stands roughly 5 feet and 5 inches tall and is a lithe\nfigure of war. The hair that flows down to the middle of her back is a pale blonde in\ncolor, almost to the point of being white. The hair itself is held into place by a leather\nstrap that ties the hair loosely right behind her neck. Her eyes are the color of a bright\nemerald green and they seem to have their own shine to them. Her skin is silky smooth\nand very light in color. At certain points on her body, you can see the blue veins that run\nunderneath her skin. Her shoulders and arms are quite slender but you can see the muscle\nthat ripples beneath the skin. She has a scar on her right forearm that is in a zigzag type\npattern. It appears to be a ghost of what it once was. Her wrists and hands are slender,\nwhich is noticed because she wears much jewelry. Bracelets around the wrist and a ring\non every finger are how she stands now. Her fingernails are trimmed down as far as they\nwill go and so much skill in how they are taken care of. They have no color to them as far\nas you can see. Her chest is small for one of her size, but she is still quite the feminine\nfigure. Her stomach is well taken care of also with muscles in groups that count to the\nnumber of 6. Her legs are quite long and again slender. You can see the muscles that run\ndown her legs through the clothing she now wears. Around her left angle is another scar\nthat is very similar, if not the same, as the one on her right wrist.\n\n\nThere is a pair of crossed Battleaxes, dripping with blood, tattooed on her left forearm. The one on the left\nappears to have a name on it. \"Nordwolf, Forever watching over us\" is what it reads. On the one on the right,\nappears to have the crest of the Darkforge family.\n\n\nThere is a new scar that runs across the tattoo of the Battleaxes.. The scar appears to be blade marks that criss-cross.\nThe scar is jagged and several parts where it looks like whomever did it, stopped to rest before continuing it.\nBy the angle of the scar, it looks self inflicted.\n    `\n  },\n  {\n    name: \"Orin Darkforge\",\n    description: `\nHere stands a rather thick musled dwarf with a freshly bald head. In the\nmiddle of his face is a large thick crooked nose. His eyes are a bright blue.\nAbout his mouth is a full thick beeard that reaches down to his belt. His\nshoulders being so large make it hard for this rotund dwarf to enter doorways.\nHis arms and legs are thick with bulging muscle that bounce as he moves.\nOn his left forarm is a tattoo of an anvil surrounded by a reddish pink flame.\nUpon closer look you can see etched on the side of the anvil is two crossed\nwarhammers that are surrounded by a purple flame. Upon his left forearm tis\na tattoo of a dagger with blood dripping off the tip and pooling underneath the\ntip that seems to have faded slightly. On the left side of his neck tis a tattoo of\na massive Broadsword. Its blade neatly polished and its hilt made of gold out\nfitted with precious dwarven gems that also has faded. On his left upper arm\nis a tattoo of a massive Warhammer. The head is a bright silver surrouned by\na blue aura. The shaft  is of oak and is wrapped in a yellow ribbon thus\nmaking the hand grip. This tattoo also seems faded. Upon his back is a large\nbattleaxe with bright golden blade with the edges dripping with blood. Etched\ninto the blade on the left tis Honor and on the blade ta the right Purity. The\nshaft is of oak carved with ancient dwarven symbols. Upon the handle burned\ninto the shaft is WARLORD.\n    `\n  },\n  {\n    name: \"Viddikren\",\n    description: `\nWhite leathery wings flutter stirring up dust and dirt around this creature. A\nlarge snout protrudes from his skull. Scaly lips part displaying teeth like\ntiny pearl daggers. A forked tongue flickers at you and then disappears\nback inside his mouth. Cold green eyes like smashed ovals surrounded in a\nsea of white stare back at the world. His gaze is fixed upon nothing yet\nseems to be absorbing everything. His entire body is covered with sickly\nwhite scales that seem to swallow the light. A long neck snakes its way\ndown to find a broad torso. This creatures short arms contain great\nstrength and speed and end in deadly talons. His torso is well protected by\na bone plate that covers its entirety. Short legs extend from his waist\nbalancing him well in spite of their frequent inactivity. Sinister spikes\nextend wickedly out of his reptilian spine from the peek of his head to the\ntip of his tail.\n\nUpon his left arm there is a tattoo of a dagger wrapped in\nvines like a tribal wrapping around his arm.\n    `\n  },\n  {\n    name: \"Vrothgard Ridgeback\",\n    description: `\nAn aura of confidence radiates from this warrior beast. A Minotaur, large for his kin,\nhe stands at an impressive nine feet in height with his shoulders being half that across.\nThe thick fur covering his arms, legs, and back is dark black and trimmed short and neat.\nThere is a strip of fur, slightly coarser, which runs against the rest of his back fur.\nThe fur on his broad chest and muscular stomach is long and wild, pure white in colour.\nThe long, thick fingers of his hand bear many scars; The skin leathered and conditioned\nfrom years of combat. Atop his large head are two massive horns, with various runes and\nmarks of battle carved into them. His eyes are large, a hunter's eyes, and always alert\nto his surroundings. His beard is dark black with streaks of white, and braided into three\nstrands. Across his right cheek, just above the jawline, you can see a fresh wound. It\nis in the early stages of healing. It appears to be a thick red line going from his chin\nto his temple. The surrounding skin is black tinged with green. Along the inside of his\nleft forearm is a tattoo of a long dagger, with an ornate handle. The word DAGGER is etched\ninto the steel. On his right arm, there is a tattoo of a large broadsword. The hilt is\nmassive, taking up his entire shoulder. The blade extends down his arm all the way to the\nwrist. The word BROADSWORD is etched into the blade, reading from top to bottom. Across\nhis broad back is a tattoo of a large warhammer. The head is placed over his right shoulder\nblade, with the haft extending to his lower back. The word WARHAMMER is carved into the haft.\nAcross the vast majority of his broad chest and muscular stomach is a tattoo of a large\nshield, inscribed with great detail. Emblazoned upon the top of shield, just below his neck\nis the word ENVOY. Wreathed through the letters are vines and flowers, which trail along the\nedges of the shield.\n    `\n  },\n  {\n    name: \"Wojciecha Haar-Meggido\",\n    description: `\nStriking auburn locks, clean and well groomed cascade to shoulder length\nand seem to glisten in the light.

A sculpted face, proportioned\nas if created by the hand of a skilled artisan, carries a soft expression.\nThe feminine lips and high cheeks add a delicate appearance which is offset\nby an athletic build, a seemingly aesthetic figure of a woman.  Demure\nin stature and overbalanced by a confident air, this woman has tan skin\nwhich looks soft, a small dagger is inked upon left calf, delicate yet\ncrafted tattoo of a broadsword.  It appears to be of elven craft.  It\ntoo is equally as sharp in appearance.  On her left forearm is a dwarven\nWarhammer, the head is depicted with a blue-green aura.  upon her\nright forearm is the shield and quill which signifies the of Envoy\nof the Crusade.

His head is\nshaved completely bald, save for a topknot situated toward the rear apex\nof his skull. From there, long white hair issues forth down to his shoulders.\nHe has the pale skin of most of his race, marred in several spots by scars, a\ncommon affliction among adventurers. His eyes are a faint blue, the color of\nextremely shadow water in a snowy valley. His face has a grim cast to it,\nbut his features are well-formed and quite symmetrical. It is said that the\nCloud Giant villages and gathering places do not have such things as\nperformers, but the beauty of this male is definitely striking. Added to\nthe thick slabs of muscle he has gained from his adventures, he makes quite\nan impression. Plus, you can see that...\n\nEtched neatly on his right bicep you notice an ornate dagger.\nUpon his left bicep you see a mighty skwirl holding a broadsword.\nUpon his right bicep you see a rather large bunny wielding a warhammer.\nEncircle about his neck you make out a blue rose encircled about a warhammer.\n    `\n  },\n  {\n    name: \"Ysbaddaden\",\n    description: `\nA monstrously tall man is before you, blue in hue.

The creatures hair\nis long and mottled, tangled in with itself around the creature's head\nand cut raggedly with a knife over the eyes. The eyes themselves are\nremarkable, as if they were two miniature seas, swirling with blues,\nlight and dark, as they look out with awareness and perception. Below\nthe creatures face a small smile can be seen, revealing crooked and\nbroken teeth. Below that, the prominance of his chin has been masked by\na full beard, which seems to be slightly more well-kempt than the hair,\nas if it had been brushed. on each side of the chin, leading down from\nthe lines of his mouth, two massive braids can be seen, securing what\nwould elsewise be a cumbersome length, the braids trailing down to his\nmid-torso. The being is clothed in a variety of white skins, which\nsimilarly have the appearance of recently being cleaned, and are only\nmoderately dirtied.\nOn his left cheek, just underneath the eye, you notice a sort of tribal tattoo, that of a dagger, placed as a teardrop.\nCrossing the dagger is a similarly made mark, that of a broadsword, particularly of note because it goes over his eyelid.\n`\n  },\n  {\n    name: \"Yuja Lightwood\",\n    description: `\nBefore you, clad in the wears of what looks to be a skilled\nfighter is Yuja.
