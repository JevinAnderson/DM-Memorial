His long black hair is not bound and\n        bounces around his face as he walks. Physically, he appears in fine\n        form, his arms and legs well muscled and a chest as broad as most humans\n        are tall. His forearms and hands appear marked with scars, and a deep,\n        jagged gouge runs the length of the outside of his left arm, reaching\n        from elbow to wrist. A red scarf is tied to his left shoulder. A dagger\n        tattoo in blood red colour is on the left arm. A large Broadsword tattoo\n        in deep blue paint is nearby. A deadly warhammer tattoo in green paint\n        is visible on the left arm, and a Battleaxe wrapped in green aura,\n        showing his rank in Crusades.\n      </p>\n      <Exits>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/canteen\">The Crusader Canteen</Link>\n      </Exits>\n    </Room>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Kevinlape;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
