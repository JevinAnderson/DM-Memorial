He's a\n        very strong looking man, with more muscle than an ordinary human.\n        Despite his bulging arms, his fingers are slender and thin, capable of\n        fast strikes with well-learned agility. He carries a scar on his right\n        cheek, from a deep and old wound. He wears light clothing and his black\n        hair comes down to his shoulders in messy bundles. He does not seem to\n        care much about his looks. Both his arms are covered by tattoos.\n        Completely encircling the arms in spirals, from shoulders to wrists, are\n        vipers painted in exquisite detail. There is an odd aroma of fresh herbs\n        around him, contradicting with his general looks. Between the coils of\n        the snake on his right arm, you see the tattoo of a dagger, dripping\n        dark poison from its tip. Between the next set of coils, you see the\n        tattoo of a broadsword, coated with crimson poison. Between the next set\n        of coils, you see the tattoo of a spiked warhammer, coated with purple\n        poison. Between the next set of coils, you see the tattoo of a\n        battleaxe, coated with green poison.\n      </p>\n      <Exits>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/intersection\">An intersection</Link>\n      </Exits>\n    </Room>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Burulli;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
