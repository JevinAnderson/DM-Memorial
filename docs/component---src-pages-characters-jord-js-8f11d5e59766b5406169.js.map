He is almost\n        completely covered in dark red blood, and everytime he moves, he leaves\n        a trail of blood in his wake. He is the most hideous giant you have ever\n        seen, and it doesn't help that he wears armor that looks to be from\n        pieces of all sorts of animals and mankind. He wields darkness itself\n        massed into a form of what looks to be a large staff. His skin and hair\n        are stained red from the blood that had a chance to dry. His shield\n        seems to have moving images on it, and the details that are shown are\n        too horrible to describe. A medallion hangs around his neck, charred and\n        mangled, but if you look carefully, you can see the gold hue that it has\n        retained from its previous form.\n      </p>\n      <Exits>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/library\">Library of the Crusades</Link>\n      </Exits>\n    </Room>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Jord;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
