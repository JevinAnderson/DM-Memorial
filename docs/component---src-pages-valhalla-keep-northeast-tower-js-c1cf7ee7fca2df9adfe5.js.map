Strong granite stones masoned\n        with exceptional skill form the cone that makes up the tower. Tall\n        stairs lead upwards, each step just below an average human's knee spiral\n        to the top, where a bit of extra stone exists which must be stepped over\n        to fully enter the top tower room. Along the circular tower wall murder\n        holes give a field of observation to that side of the castle, but\n        unfortunately, not downward at the country- side below. There seem to be\n        some small markings on the wall hidden among the various scratches and\n        chips in the stone. Green moss grows between the grooves of the fine\n        stone. A damp, cool breeze blows through this part of the tower. Along\n        the base of the northern wall is a marble pipe leading toward the west,\n        and rising upward and then through a marble box-shaped structure\n        standing upon a tripod of marble legs. The top of the marble box is an\n        iron grate, and smoke rises from it. The marble pipe exits out the other\n        side and rises up the northern wall until it disappears through the\n        ceiling. Another pipe runs across the ceiling and down the northern wall\n        until it finds one of the murder holes, at which point it turns outward\n        and stops. Water drips from its open end to the ground below.\n      </p>\n      <Exits>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/east-side\">west</Link>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/northeast-tower-top\">up</Link>\n      </Exits>\n      <Characters>\n        <Link to=\"/characters/yamakaze\">\n          Yamakaze Tymoran, guardian of the Shrine to Joja, sits in quiet\n          meditation.\n        </Link>\n        <Link to=\"/characters/rakzar\">Rakzar is here.</Link>\n        <Link to=\"/characters/sengeril\">Sengeril is here.</Link>\n      </Characters>\n    </Room>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default NorthEastTower;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport PropTypes from \"prop-types\";\n\nimport styles from \"./characters.module.css\";\n\nconst Characters = ({ children }) => (\n  <div className={styles.characters}>{children}</div>\n);\n\nCharacters.propTypes = {\n  children: PropTypes.node\n};\n\nexport default Characters;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
