Its unusual color and length accentuates her beauty,\n        making her unique among elves. The tresses looks shiny and healthy and\n        always worn half-braided to keep the curls off from her serene face. Her\n        eyes are the color of emerald, stunning, with tiny gold flecks. Her\n        features are as well chiselled as any average elf with straight nose and\n        a smiling mouth. Her lips are soft, the color of pink rose petals. Her\n        chin is small and firm that speaks determination and hints at\n        stubbornness. Her skin is the color of alabaster, perfect and flawless\n        with no blemishes. She's thin and slender, looking fragile and\n        vulnerable but her light weight contributes to her agility. Her long and\n        slim fingers give an indication that she's adept in wielding weapons\n        gracefully. However, it's free of callus and appears soft to touch.\n      </p>\n      <Exits>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/banquet\">The Banquet Hall</Link>\n      </Exits>\n    </Room>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Nessa;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
