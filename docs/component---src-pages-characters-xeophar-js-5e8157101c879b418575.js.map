Tentacles protrude from its\r\n        clothing at irregular intervals. In some places they emerge from\r\n        sleeves, in others, they emerge from holes torn into its garments to\r\n        accommodate these strange appendages. Its black skin is oily and slick\r\n        in a few sporadic patches covered with slime. The rest of it has dried\r\n        and taken on the look and feel of rubber. There is a faint odor to it\r\n        that, while difficult to place, will be quite memorable for its pungent\r\n        stench. Its writhing mass of limbs seem to pulse with chaotic motion\r\n        that contrasts with Xeophar's purposeful movements. At the same time\r\n        some of Xeophar's limbs deftly wield wands and weapons, others lazily\r\n        brush nearby objects seemingly without intent or reason. Two of these\r\n        tentacles lay lifeless and limp as though dead. A third tentacle moves\r\n        sluggishly and occasionally spasms as though it will soon join the dead\r\n        limbs in their quiet slumber. The last thing one might notice, is\r\n        Xeophar's rather large and bulbous eye. It has a single eye that glows\r\n        with a reddish hue, and seems to sparkle with energy. The clear liquid\r\n        coating that might cover such an eye seems to have dried up. This does\r\n        not appear to bother Xeophar, and the material of the eye itself seems\r\n        to have hardened into some sort of glass like substance.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <Exits>\r\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/tower\">The Tower</Link>\r\n      </Exits>\r\n    </Room>\r\n  </Layout>\r\n);\r\n\r\nexport default Xeophar;\r\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
