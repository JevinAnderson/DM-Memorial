The radiant\n        emerald green tint of his eyes matches the skin and fur patching out\n        about his person everywhere, furled around large biceps, forearms and\n        full, thick legs. He stands tall at 13', but he looks like a regular\n        piece of scenery, and doesn't seem too obtrusive. He almost looks like\n        an out of place garden, roaming innocently. Looking more fresh than his\n        weathered skin is a black tattoo, just below his collarbone, laterally\n        across his chest; a flat, long-handled dagger. His right thigh holds the\n        hilt of a large broadsword tattoo that runs to its tip at the bottom of\n        his shin. Over the bumps of fauna and muscle rippling his back, the\n        handle of a Warhammer tattoo stretches up his spine and the maul of the\n        hammer stretches out over his massive right shoulderblade. A menacing\n        looking double-sided BattleAxe is stretched across both his pectorcal\n        muscles, on a slight slant- the handle stretches down into the right\n        part of his hip.\n        <br />A horizontal burn mark, a fluorescent green battleaxe, crosses his\n        forehead. It's mostly dark, but looks to be pulsing.\n      </p>\n      <Exits>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/large-barracks\">\n          A large Crusader Barracks\n        </Link>\n      </Exits>\n    </Room>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Bleyard;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
