It is hard to tell if this\n        creature before you is a male or female, but by the looks of the\n        clothing and scars over this creatures body, this one is definitely\n        male. It has the lower segment on the ground with four legs supporting\n        its massive frame. Standing upright are the other two segments of his\n        body and standing that way, it appears to be almost 5 feet tall. The\n        upper arms are strong and thick and appear to be used to being used to\n        carry things. His whole body has a liquid grace to it when he moves. His\n        eyes are a dark brown in color that almost match the color of his whole\n        body. He wears clothing like others but he wears them with distain. He\n        is baggy looking in those clothes.. Upon his upper breast plate, there\n        is a marking that is visable through the clothing he wears. This marking\n        is that of an Ant standing over a pile of something.. It worn over the\n        years, but it appears this large Ant is protecting the pile.\n        <br />\n        Upon the right side of his head, there is a black and gold looking\n        DAGGER that appears to be stuck into his head, blade first. Upon the\n        left side of his head, there is a grey and red colored BROADSWORD that\n        appears to be sticking out of the side of his head! Upon the upper part\n        of his torso, there is a deep purple and red WARHAMMER with its head\n        appearing to be stuck through his carpace!!! Upon the Center part of his\n        chest, there is a bright red **ENVOY** tattooed there that is outlined\n        in yellow!\n      </p>\n      <Exits>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/intersection\">An intersection</Link>\n      </Exits>\n    </Room>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Nagac;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
