His punches whistle in the air with lightning speed. His\n        healing has been known to aid his fellow Crusaders in their honorable\n        fight. All his sisters and brothers need to do is say, 'Aid me, monk'\n        and his healing is theirs.\n      </p>\n      <Exits>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/battle-room\">The Battle Room</Link>\n      </Exits>\n    </Room>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Liming;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
