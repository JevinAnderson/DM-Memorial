From quite a distance you began to hear this powerful dwarf walking in your direction. Fully clad in armor, not a single part of his bare skin is showing. Looking boldly at you, pitch-black eyes with a glow of crimson hatred penetrate the air with a vile glow of determination. A full beard falls down towards his breastplate of a charcoal color, neatly tied with small beads at its bottom. Grinning widely this dwarf always seems to be showing his pearly white teeth. A small jagged scar can be seen on his left cheek, perhaps the sweet touch of a sharp blade. Wrapped around the hilt of his blade a small figurine can be seen of a beautiful golden shade. Seemingly this is something very important to this proud dwarf. Black hair cascades out of his sturdy helmet down towards the midsection of his back. An aura of power and wisdom radiates from this dwarf filling the very air. Across his left forearm you notice that of a small dagger slicing through a bloody heart. Running down his left arm, under his sleeves is that of a mighty broadsword. Across his chest yet another tattoo is seen, this of a powerful warhammer slamming down upon the shattered skull of an archmage. Under his left eye, on his cheek is a small tattoo of an ancient battleaxe, green in color though red at the blade's edge. He wears, strapped to his back, a powerful battleaxe named Bane of Magic but uses lesser weapons to help his students train."),s.a.createElement(n.a,null,s.a.createElement(h.Link,{to:"/valhalla/keep/southwest-tower-top"},"The Top of the Southwest Tower"))))}}}]);
