Cool back story.\n          Infinite drama between playing in Outlaw/Enforcer/Marauder\n        </p>\n        <p>Played a lot of channeled and elementalists</p>\n        <p>Baghib. Got in four houses and left each on good terms.</p>\n        <p>\n          Largo: (Lifer wannabe Halfling Beastmaster) - He tried to pugil the\n          FREAKING meteor that destroyed The Tree. Died hilariously. Adjrinne:\n          (Conclaver Centaur Aquamancer) - She was literally the first\n          non-intelligent character that I played, and every moment in her\n          hooves was amazing.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Jakarath, my first char will always be my favorite. Mostly because I\n          had a lot of free time and could get involved with a lot the various\n          things going on. I wasn't a very noteworthy char, but I was able to\n          join Valor and battle Legion with and against some great RPers who\n          really helped me get lost in it.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Xomo. I had intended for him to be the last MUD char I would ever\n          play. Ended up getting the Shrine of Chaos destroyed and got to RP\n          with Xurinos, himself.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Nerika; Dark-Elf Warrior in Justicar before warrior subs. Upholding\n          the law and bending it to your own ends as an evil character was\n          really interesting and fun.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Abyssinian. Ancient nightwalker alias Specter. First character where i\n          truly felt proficient in PK\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Lorthalien.. Covenant was a fun house with a great RP, good people in\n          the house, and a lot of fun with the military styled theme.\n        </p>\n        <p>Marcellus - Caption of Legion when things were in full swing</p>\n        <p>\n          Toade. Xyza brand for the first time was a high point, and I was proud\n          of the character concept and development thru and thru.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Arngrinm just because i enjoyed all the interactions i had with this\n          char\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Rumpledumple Finglefrumplestien gnome Archwizard of Twilight it was\n          great trolling people as a illusionist. Cast heatmetal; get all; flee;\n          cast teleport; sit back and laaaaauuugh\n        </p>\n        <p>Vordok</p>\n        <p>\n          Quasator. Was a really fun Rung branded nightwalker that terrorized a\n          lot of people Or Sardesai because we had a good RP that he was\n          terribly smelly and Joja even gave him a permanent (STINKY) aura\n        </p>\n        <p>Nazarx</p>\n        <p>\n          Renault - Burned through his life in about 250 hours. Played pure\n          suicidal chaotic thief; was super weak but killed and robbed some of\n          the most powerful people, clans, and houses in the game.\n        </p>\n        <p>I don't have a favorite</p>\n        <p>Serla - Fun RP been in Empire but not really sharing their goals.</p>\n        <p>aduren, palaremzi, kahraman</p>\n        <p>\n          Mikhale - first character that got an RP item, brand, and lead a house\n          (Syndicate) OR Tilion - RP'd from Crusader into Brethren when it made\n          its comeback. I'll never forget being completely surprised seeing the\n          induction message. Also managed to make my way out of hell after\n          getting eaten by the demon pet (was told it wasn't possible) which I\n          was kind of proud of.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Barthalomew the slug king. I rp'ed a changer in Justicar who was a\n          giant slug king. Nyrisia gave him a salt shaker necklace that burned\n          him from time to time when she was around. I ended up getting her orb\n          brand, and had a blast with him.\n        </p>\n        <p>Ashanti Darksbane</p>\n        <HRBorder />\n      </div>\n    </Container>\n  </SurveyLayout>\n);\n\nexport default Character;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
