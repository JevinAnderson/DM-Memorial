Quite possibly drunk, the being before you is\n        plainly adorned as you see him. Drooping down from his forge-darkened\n        face is a roughly cropped, waist length beard of silvery grey striated\n        with veins of coal black and fiery red. With so much grey apparent, this\n        is a rather aged being. Protruding from the chin of this....ruffian are\n        two well groomed braids of long facial hair. Now noticing his piercing\n        blue eyes, your sight shortly lingers on a faded tattoo of a hammer and\n        anvil. Perhaps this faded tattoo might be an indication as to why his\n        braids are always tucked behind his ears. The blood of an enemy is not\n        conducive to good personal grooming. You can't help but notice a\n        decidedly grumpy air about this one. Talk about one damn grumpy dwarf...\n      </p>\n      <Exits>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/bar\">The Crusader Bar</Link>\n      </Exits>\n    </Room>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Gryleth;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
