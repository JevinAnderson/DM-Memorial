A green tattoo runs down his tan face from the top of his forehead, down through his left eye, stopping at the middle of chin. On the right side of his neck, you see a small dagger engraved, and glowing the same dark green as the tattoo on his face. Surround- ing this dagger, is a broadsword of great size, which signifies his rank in the eternal crusades.
