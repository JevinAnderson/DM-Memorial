Strong granite stones masoned\n        with exceptional skill form the cone that makes up the tower. Tall\n        stairs lead upwards, each step just below an average human's knee spiral\n        to the top. Along the tower walls murder holes give a field of\n        observation to that side of the castle. Green moss grows between the\n        grooves of the fine stone. A damp cool breeze of air blows through the\n        tower.\n      </p>\n      <Exits>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/green-room\">west</Link>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/southeast-tower-top\">up</Link>\n      </Exits>\n    </Room>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default SoutheastTower;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
