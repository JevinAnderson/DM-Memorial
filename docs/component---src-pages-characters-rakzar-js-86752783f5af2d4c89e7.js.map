He has long, shoulder length black hair that has a\n        slightly greasy look as though it has not been washed. His eyes are a\n        sade of dark emerald and appear to have a hidden intelligence. His neck\n        is strong and roped with thick cords. It is obvious from his being and\n        swagger than he is very powerful. His face is creased with lines that\n        show his mouth has experience both in a scowl and a smile. His broad\n        shoulders look ready for any physical task. A finely etched dagger can\n        be seen running the length of his right forearm. Upon his vast neck\n        there is the last fourth of so of a mighty blade. The remainder of the\n        deadly broadsword spans the length of his massive chest. On the back of\n        his neck, the head of a great spiked warhammer, with the rest of its\n        golden shaft running down then length of his back. The warhammer appears\n        encrusted with jewels.\n      </p>\n      <Exits>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/northeast-tower\">The Northeast Tower</Link>\n      </Exits>\n    </Room>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Rakzar;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
