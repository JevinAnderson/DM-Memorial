So I don't count it. My favorite\n          interaction was as Ethimos when he was more-or-less brutalized,\n          interrogated, muted and faced potential exile from the Tower. The\n          interaction was with Ishq and Nyrisia. Tehain was an awesome drow to\n          RP with, too. Tako was a hoot. Isnar- creeper.

RPing with Nyrisia in the lead up to Brethren coming\n          back.
