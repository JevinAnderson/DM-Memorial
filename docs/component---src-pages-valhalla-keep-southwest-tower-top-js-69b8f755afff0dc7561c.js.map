Upon another wall is a\n        huge golden plaque with names engraved upon it. A honeysuckle vine grows\n        along the walls, its leaves and flowers reaching out over just about\n        every inch of the walls, its roots dug into the floor beneath the\n        plaque, a few roots reaching upward and acting as the source of a steady\n        flow of honeysuckle nectar which falls into a shining golden basin.\n        Amidst the splendor of the flowering vines are trophies of mage heads,\n        beneath which a great weapon hangs in honor.
