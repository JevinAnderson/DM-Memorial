The\n        western wall is filled with a large, beautiful blue curtain of sturdy\n        make. The curtain is bound by large, polished brass rings allowing it to\n        be closed or opened at will. A huge, glass roof covers the top of the\n        Tower. This beautiful roof is held on metal hinges on both sides\n        allowing the roof to be retracted open or closed at will. The glass is\n        perfectly transparent allowing sunlight or moonlight to find the bottom\n        of the floor with ease. Completely encircling the perimeter of the tower\n        floor is a layer of stone, seemingly a second layer to what was once the\n        first (wall) layer, and high enough to require that you step over and\n        onto the tower room floor. That floor is covered with moist soil, thick\n        in mulch, mixed with decaying leaves, through which many plants have\n        sprouted. The trees which grow here are twisted and bent. Parts of them\n        look dead, but new growth has sprouted, and the leaves are a healthy\n        green. Some of the shrubs have also taken a beating, it appears, but\n        they, too, have new greenery to show for their fight against the\n        elements. Near the twisted trees, in the center of the soil-filled\n        floor, off to the side of the worn path, is a construction known as a\n        dakota hole. At the base of the northern wall and the secondary inner\n        wall, a marble pipe emerges upward, and warm water trickles out and\n        soaks the ever moist, mulchy soil. The northern wall appears is perfect\n        shape, even polished of any dirt or blemishes. On the right side of the\n        northern wall there is a remaining tree leaning heavily against the top\n        of the wall, its purchase on the shallow floor iffy. The southern wall\n        has small ivy vines holding grip to the small grooves in the wall, their\n        tiny green leaves seeking sunlight. A small grouping of pink roses\n        appears to have taken root near one of the green shrubs. Near another\n        green shrub a small grouping of yellow tulips grows. A small white lily\n        grows near the base of one of the smaller trees. A huge grouping of\n        bright orange and yellow flowers grows in the eastern section among a\n        few small green shrubs. A small sprig of purple violets grows outside an\n        overturned box and between two green shrubs. tower.\n      </p>\n      <Exits>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/northeast-tower\">down</Link>\n      </Exits>\n      <Characters>\n        <Link to=\"/characters/joja\">\n          (OUTLAW) <DeepBlue /> A tall, slim, fair elven lady with enormous\n          wings of fluffy white feathers is here.\n        </Link>\n        <Link to=\"/characters/krazar\">\n          A Massive Titan, Surrounded by a Dark Aura\n        </Link>\n      </Characters>\n    </Room>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default NorthEastTowerTop;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport PropTypes from \"prop-types\";\n\nimport styles from \"./characters.module.css\";\n\nconst Characters = ({ children }) => (\n  <div className={styles.characters}>{children}</div>\n);\n\nCharacters.propTypes = {\n  children: PropTypes.node\n};\n\nexport default Characters;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
