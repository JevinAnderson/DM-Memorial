The cloak itself is very dark blue, nearly black in color, like a midnight sky, and has a slightly velvety quality to it. On either side of the simple clasp a deep-blue rose is embroidered, bright and distinct in contrast to the darkness of the cloak. The roses' stems, complete with thorns, are stitched in vibrant green, each sharpening at the end to the point of a quill.",i.a.createElement("br",null),"Tyberius carries himself with an air of confidence, his every move betraying the dangerous grace of a practiced warrior, like a big predatory cat. His short-cropped hair is thick and dark, as is the rough stubble of a few days growth that frames his almost-handsome face. Appearing to be in his early middle-years, an expression of wary vigilance is etched in his features. However, his near-black eyes speak of years that his face does not, causing you to reconsider your estimate of his age. His gaze is sharp, smoldering with intensity as he keeps careful watch on his surroundings.",i.a.createElement("br",null),"The skin of his face and neck appears smooth and youthful, and is marked with a number of tattoos. Upon his cheekbone, just under his left eye, is a blood-red teardrop, frozen forever in its joyless path. Directly next to it is a small, black dagger with a long, triangular blade. Two more tattoos can be seen, one on either side of his neck. On the right side, a heavy-bladed broadsword is etched into his flesh, while a massive warhammer marks the left side. Between them, just below his Adam's apple, is an intricate tattoo of a rapier crossing a war gauntlet."),i.a.createElement(l.a,null,i.a.createElement(h.Link,{to:"/valhalla/keep/hall-of-history"},"The Hall of History"))))}}}]);
