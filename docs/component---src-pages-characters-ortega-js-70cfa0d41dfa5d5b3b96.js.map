His hair is a dark black like that\n        of a ravens feathers. He slicks his hair back to his skull to prevent\n        interference of his vision. Looking into his brown eyes you see a\n        burning intellect hidden deep within. His skin a pale white and is free\n        of scars or blemishes. His mouth closed in to a neutral expression. His\n        nostrils slightly flare savoring the air. His neck is covered by the\n        collar of his torso wear. A black garment covers his chest that buttons\n        along his left side. This black long sleeved covering does much to\n        conceal the tone of his body. His hands can be clearly seen against the\n        blackness of his top. His fingers are long and swift. The ends of those\n        fingers are well kept nails. They have been trimmed short and cleaned\n        vigorously. Covering his legs are trousers of the same material as his\n        top. The leggings as well as the top have been well maintained. You can\n        see no stains nor lint on either garment. Again the angles of material\n        are angular hiding any tone of his legs. His feet are covered in dark\n        shoes. Despite they travel on the ground no dirt can be seen on either\n        shoe. Upon his left arm he bares a tattoo of a DAGGER. Under the Dagger,\n        a large BROADSWORD stretches down his forearm. Upon the blade is the\n        word 'Harmony'. On his right arm you see a beautiful WARHAMMER. The\n        shaft is made of gold so pure it is is white in color. Upon the head of\n        the hammer is the word 'Purity'. A long wooden handle stretches up his\n        forearm. The wood leads to a wicked BATTLEAXE. Written above the head of\n        the axe is, 'ROSIE'.\n      </p>\n      <Exits>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/armory\">The Armory</Link>\n      </Exits>\n    </Room>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Ortega;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
