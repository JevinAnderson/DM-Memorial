His\n        head is shaved completely bald, save for a topknot situated toward the\n        rear apex of his skull. From there, long white hair issues forth down to\n        his shoulders. He has the pale skin of most of his race, marred in\n        several spots by scars, a common affliction among adventurers. His eyes\n        are a faint blue, the color of extremely shadow water in a snowy valley.\n        His face has a grim cast to it but his features are well-formed and\n        quite symmetrical. It is said that the Cloud Giant villages and\n        gathering places do not have such things as performers, but the beauty\n        of this male is definitely striking. Added to the thick slabs of muscle\n        he has gained from his adventures, he makes quite an impression on any\n        that look upon him.\n        <br />\n        Etched neatly upon his right arm you notice an ornate dagger of simple\n        make.\n        <br />\n        Etched carefully upon his left arm is a simple broadsword of elven make.\n        <br />\n        Etched onto the side of his neck you notice a bunny wielding a massive\n        warhammer.\n        <br />\n        Looking at his left ear you can see where a blue rose has been etched\n        into it.\n        <br />\n        Etched into his bald head like a crown you see the image of a battleaxe.\n      </p>\n      <Exits>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/green-room\">The Green Room</Link>\n      </Exits>\n    </Room>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Terius;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
