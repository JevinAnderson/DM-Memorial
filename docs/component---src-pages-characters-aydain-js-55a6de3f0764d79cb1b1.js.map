Her icy blue eyes sparkle with a hint of\n        amusement while her mouth curls upward in a slight smile. It might echo\n        the amusement in her eyes. Long golden hair cascades in tresses down her\n        back, beyond her waist, allowed to flow freely without the bond of a\n        pretty ribbon or leather strap. Clothing fit for one of the rangers\n        guild graces her slim, muscular form. She wears little in the way of\n        fancy jewelry and no color added to her face at all, preferring an all\n        natural look. Along her right forearm is a tattoo of a dagger, its blade\n        softly glowing with a white light, signifying her rank in the Never-\n        ending Crusades. Spanning the length of her left forearm is a freshly\n        healing wound in the shape of a broadsword, as though carved with a\n        knife and fashioned of her blood and healing flesh.\n      </p>\n      <Exits>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/green-room\">The Green Room</Link>\n      </Exits>\n    </Room>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Aydain;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
