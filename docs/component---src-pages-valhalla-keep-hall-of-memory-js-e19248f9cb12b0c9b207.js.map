The placement of each stone is with near\r\n        perfection, impressing anyone with the knowledge of architecture.\r\n        Numerous pictures of famed battles entirely cover the walls and\r\n        ceilings, and famous Crusader legends adorn the hall in the form of\r\n        lifelike marble statues.
