Judging from his well polished elysium armoring, he is a Knightly\n        fashion. Most of his body is covered in a some kind of armoring so his\n        physical stature is not visible. A helmet covers his head hiding\n        everything but illuminating red eyes, that can be seen from with two eye\n        slits. A broad pair of brass colored wings extend from the Knight's back\n        draping toward the ground. Wielded in one hand is a longsword with an\n        eerie glow. A rather large shield is held in the other hand, blocking\n        the entire view of the left side of the Knight. A tightly strung grey\n        silken sash is wrapped around the waist and connected to the leather\n        belt that holds the lower part of his armor together. Upon the sash\n        words art written that spell \"Envoy\". Even further investigation will\n        show, a small brass tail that seems to be behind the Knight. His feet\n        are adorned in some rather thick boots of some kind, but sharp claws\n        seem to be protruding the front portion of the boots. Strapped to the\n        back and waist side of the Knight are a multitude of different types of\n        weapons. Some glowing with the same eerie hum as the longsword and\n        others looking rather dull grey compared to those that do glow. Upon the\n        chest plate of this knight, an insignia of some kind can be seen. It is\n        a very Large Warhammer. Upon the shoulder guards of the knight there is\n        a symbol of a Dagger. The large shield is adorned with a symbol as well,\n        that of a huge Broadsword. Hanging from his neck on a sturdy golden\n        chain is a pendant bearing the symbol of a Living Battleaxe. A sturdy\n        silver chain around his neck bears a pendant which hangs just below the\n        Living Battleaxe pendant, this one bearing the symbol of a deep blue\n        rose whose green thorny stem ends in a quill tip.{\" \"}\n      </p>\n      <Exits>\n        <Link to=\"/valhalla/keep/chamber-of-decisions\">\n          The Chamber of Decisions\n        </Link>\n      </Exits>\n    </Room>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Vledimire;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
