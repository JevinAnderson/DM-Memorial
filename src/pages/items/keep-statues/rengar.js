    A statue of a human warrior stands here. He dual wields swords and looks
    vicious. In his third hand (!) is a shield. He wears good armor, but his
    torso is uncovered by anything truly protective beyond a cape. <br />
    On the plaque on the pedestal, are the words,
    <br /> Rengar, First Leader of the Crusades
    <br /> First Age
