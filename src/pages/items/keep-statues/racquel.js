  <Statue title="Racquel, Leader of the Crusades">
    A statue of a female human stands here. She wears light armor and dual
    wields a pair of daggers, her shoulder-length hair flowing freely, as though
    a breeze blows through it. From the size of the statue, she appears to be
    about five and a half feet tall, and of muscular build. Her stance implies
    that her matching daggers are equally deadly, no matter which hand holds
    each.
    <br />
    On the plaque on the pedestal, are the words,
    <br />
    Racquel, Leader of the Crusades
    <br />
    First Age
