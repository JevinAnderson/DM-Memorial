          I wish I could have had more experience with clans, as it is, I never
          joined or really interacted "on a level" with someone who was. I
          really only knew about 2 anyway, Drakontas Sporos and Guild of
          Alchemical Research.

          dr'Rhillzznae, thought it's the only one I had any interactions with.

          I refuse to answer. there were so many good ones. Drakontos Sporos,
          Golden Leaf Society, Cult of Worm amongst them.

        <p>Wasn't into clans so much</p>

          Dark Alliance - Completely player run clan that came out of nowhere
          and fought Houses, then fizzled out due to lack of any support.

          Didn't do a lot of Clan RP outside of the old draconian clan, Darkotos
          Soros or something?
        </p>
        <p>
          Never joined any clans... I always thought the dark-elf clan had a
          cool history/premise.
