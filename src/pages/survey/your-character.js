        <h1>Who was your favorite character that you played? Why?</h1>
        <p>
          Meia; Longest history. Love story ({"<3"} to Eva). Cool back story.
          Infinite drama between playing in Outlaw/Enforcer/Marauder
        </p>
        <p>Played a lot of channeled and elementalists</p>
        <p>Baghib. Got in four houses and left each on good terms.</p>
        <p>
          Largo: (Lifer wannabe Halfling Beastmaster) - He tried to pugil the
          FREAKING meteor that destroyed The Tree. Died hilariously. Adjrinne:
          (Conclaver Centaur Aquamancer) - She was literally the first
          non-intelligent character that I played, and every moment in her
          hooves was amazing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jakarath, my first char will always be my favorite. Mostly because I
          had a lot of free time and could get involved with a lot the various
          things going on. I wasn't a very noteworthy char, but I was able to
          join Valor and battle Legion with and against some great RPers who
          really helped me get lost in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Xomo. I had intended for him to be the last MUD char I would ever
          play. Ended up getting the Shrine of Chaos destroyed and got to RP
          with Xurinos, himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nerika; Dark-Elf Warrior in Justicar before warrior subs. Upholding
          the law and bending it to your own ends as an evil character was
          really interesting and fun.
        </p>

          Abyssinian. Ancient nightwalker alias Specter. First character where i
          truly felt proficient in PK
        </p>
        <p>
          Lorthalien.. Covenant was a fun house with a great RP, good people in
          the house, and a lot of fun with the military styled theme.
        </p>
        <p>Marcellus - Caption of Legion when things were in full swing</p>
        <p>
          Toade. Xyza brand for the first time was a high point, and I was proud
          of the character concept and development thru and thru.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arngrinm just because i enjoyed all the interactions i had with this
          char
        </p>
        <p>
          Rumpledumple Finglefrumplestien gnome Archwizard of Twilight it was
          great trolling people as a illusionist. Cast heatmetal; get all; flee;
          cast teleport; sit back and laaaaauuugh
        </p>
        <p>Vordok</p>
        <p>
          Quasator. Was a really fun Rung branded nightwalker that terrorized a
          lot of people Or Sardesai because we had a good RP that he was
          terribly smelly and Joja even gave him a permanent (STINKY) aura
        </p>
        <p>Nazarx</p>
        <p>
          Renault - Burned through his life in about 250 hours. Played pure
          suicidal chaotic thief; was super weak but killed and robbed some of
          the most powerful people, clans, and houses in the game.
        </p>
        <p>I don't have a favorite</p>
        <p>Serla - Fun RP been in Empire but not really sharing their goals.</p>
        <p>aduren, palaremzi, kahraman</p>
        <p>
          Mikhale - first character that got an RP item, brand, and lead a house
          (Syndicate) OR Tilion - RP'd from Crusader into Brethren when it made
          its comeback. I'll never forget being completely surprised seeing the
          induction message. Also managed to make my way out of hell after
          getting eaten by the demon pet (was told it wasn't possible) which I
          was kind of proud of.
        </p>
        <p>
          Barthalomew the slug king. I rp'ed a changer in Justicar who was a
          giant slug king. Nyrisia gave him a salt shaker necklace that burned
          him from time to time when she was around. I ended up getting her orb
          brand, and had a blast with him.
