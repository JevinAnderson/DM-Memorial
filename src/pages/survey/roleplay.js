        <p>The fall of Arcana. Though it was also kind of sad to me.</p>

          I would say my favorite interaction was with Xurinos in the wreckage
          of the Shrine of Chaos, but I froze during the RP from a mix of being
          star-stricken and shocked. So I don't count it. My favorite
          interaction was as Ethimos when he was more-or-less brutalized,
          interrogated, muted and faced potential exile from the Tower. The
          interaction was with Ishq and Nyrisia. Tehain was an awesome drow to
          RP with, too. Tako was a hoot. Isnar- creeper. I guess I answered a
          number of questions to this one. Sorry. Some peeps you just can't
          leave out.

          Applying to outlaw with my first character. Hashkar was leader. I
          seriously botched the process. Learned so much.

        <p>Anything when Styx became involved.</p>

          too many to count, but it most certainly took place in MS Glyndane.

        <p>I tried to rob Kontina, and ended up getting their brand.</p>
        <p>Joja and some fellow crusaders as we were going for MoP</p>

          Anything I did with Yophlin with my necro including when he got me
          branded

          Not a specific event but the complex dynamic between alignment, ethos
          and house. Example. Goodie in law house and criminal in goodie house
          also goodie and evil in the same house. Made for memorial play and
          interactions.

          Having a secret message from my character added to the Glyndane Monk's
          Dojo room.

          Probably 'kissing' my pegasus thinking it was like a kiss on the
          forehead and been tormented by the other members of valor for
          bestiality! :)

        <p>Barker and Joja</p>

          Loved RPing with Fizzfaldt when he was all about preserving childlike
          innocence and coming up with a unique take on the concept with an AP
          and got branded. RPing with Nyrisia in the lead up to Brethren coming
          back. Favorite though is Nixalis and RPing a talking bracer and
          starting a 'church of the holy bracer' clan before receiving the
          brand.

          The various interactions I had with Brofirir while playing a couple
          different alts were always amusing and fun. He inspired me to roll up
          a halfling for my one of my next characters.
