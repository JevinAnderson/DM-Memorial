      <h1>Korrick</h1>
      <p>
        Before you is a handsome creature that appears to be both beast and man.
        His long silver hair drapes like a cape across his back. His dark face
        is marred from a life of battle and time spent in the elements. Age
        lines become visible on his forehead when he squints his eyes. His eyes
        a cold green that burn with an intensity that could pierce even the
        thickest of foliage. Even with crows feet forming at the corner of his
        eyes. His intellect still shines brightly behind those eyes. His nose is
        slightly bent were it has been broken and reset many times. His lips
        conceal a set of straight teeth that have been well cared for over the
        years. His rather impressive torso is covered only in simple white
        tunic. The tunic is flawless black with a crimson cross surrounded by a
        thick circle of the same shade. His arms move with a grace and strength
        that suggests this beast knows how to use those blades he holds. Upon
        his right hand this creature bears burnt flesh in the shape of a
        Lantern. Below his torso begins the body of a stallion. A fine white
        steed by the looks of things. His pale fur is silky and soft to the
        touch. A fine glow that once came from the sheen of the fur, has begun
        to fade with time. A slight sway can be seen in his spine, but make no
        mistake this magnificent animal is thoroughbred. A silver streak
        radiates in the passing shadows. This alien marking seems very strange,
        as it appears to have fallen upon this beast's back from the heavens. A
        slight coil of smoke can be seen entwining with this strange liquid.
        Surprisingly white and very clean hooves keep this creature mobile.
        Above them, powerful legs move with great agility. On his left arm is
        the fine art work of Kug. On his left bicep is a well crafted DAGGER
        with its blade extending down toward his elbow. A golden blade is the
        first thing you notice, a pale gold almost as though it were sick. The
        solid oak handle is inlaid with the word Honor. Upon the blade in silver
        is the word BROADSWORD. A ray of light breaking through the dark clouds.
        A brilliant corona surrounds a silver master piece of warfare, Behind
        the blinding light rest a devastating WARHAMMER. Inscribed on the handle
        is the words 'Faith'. A quiet meadow spreads out before you. A large
        army stands ready. In the front bearing a Banner of the Clan is the
        LEADER. What is this? Pink and blue ribbons have been braided into his
        tail. His tail of twinkling fear flicks in a swirl of color behind him.
