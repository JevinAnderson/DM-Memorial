Should you happen to catch a glympse of Splythe, you'ld notice he stands 
roughly 6 feet tall. With his long silver hair hanging to his shoulders, his 
face is not unattractive. And his lavender eyes illuminate his sharp features.
   His build is slender, but strong, and he walks with a sort of grace,
like that of a dancer. There is a certain alertness to him as well, he seems to
be looking, if not seeing, everything. His gaze sweeps around his surroundings
looking for any sign of trouble.
   He dresses lightly and in dark cloathing. Preffering black cloaks to more
blend into the shadows. And he wears his cloak well enough to conceal his 
weapons and armor, so that he has a more casual look so as not to draw 
unwanted attention.
And in his profession, any attention is unwanted.
Upon closer inspection you notice that,

The Hell of Crawling Darkness
  You see before you a dimly-lit cavern, apparently far, far 
underground. The only light is that shed from some strange
phosphorescent fungus that grows thickly in about every surface.
The walls and floor seem to be almost shimmering, but upon closer
inspection you see that every surface is alive with insects, slugs,
and all many of vermin. To your horror, you see mortals brutally
chained to stalagmite columns, their eyes held open by metal bands;
their screams muffled by huge hunks of rotting meat that gag their
mouths...the insects make their way into everything here...
[Exits: north east south west]
A misshapen Griekul stands here, bound to servitude.
(White Aura) A terrifying demon lord stands before you in all it's profane glory!

The Hell of the Upside-Down Sinners
  This appears to be an unending series of domed chambers, stretching
off to infinity in all directions. From the rafters of each chamber
hang hundreds of mortals, naked and bound with thin bands of
metal. Each one is suspended upside down, slowing starving and 
descending into madness in the stale, humid air.  Blisters and 
flesh rubbed raw by the restraints drip blood and puss onto
the oddly-warm floor, and a sick-smelling haze is everpresent.
[Exits: north east south west]
(Holy Aura) A terrifying demon lord stands before you in all it's profane glory!

The Hell of Sinful Flesh
  This place is twisted beyond imagining. Damned mortals beyond
number are here, all restrained in some twisted, painful fashion to
concrete slabs, or twisted devices of profane genious. Each of these
men and women is violated in every conceivable way by learing, drooling
hordes of devils. When the mortal bodies can take no more, new
orifices are created for the demon's pleasure...
[Exits: north east south west]
A mind-rending Dragkagh stands here, bound to servitude.

The Hell of Being Cut to Pieces
  This place is a huge cavern, dark, let illuminated by some unseen
light source. The entire area, stretching onward in every direction,
is bathed in a sickly red glow. Demons are all around, dissecting
unfortunate mortals in a variety of ways, some rapidly and brutally,
others slowly and with excrutiating precision. One thing is constant
though...the screams.
[Exits: north east south west]

The Hell of Endless Waking                                        
  This place is an endless, desolate plain. A scorching yellow
sun burns above at all times, and stinging sand is blown about                  
constantly on searing hot winds. No shelter is to be found, no
solace 
here for the weary damn souls, who are doomed to wander this
place, pursued forever by vile, winged fiends in the skies above. 
[Exits: north east south west]                                              
A misshapen Griekul stands here, bound to servitude.
(White Aura) A terrifying demon lord stands before you in all it's profane glory!

The Hell of Twisted Ropes     
  This place appears to be an endless collection of rooms, all
with walls of dull, cold metal. Every room is dedicated to the
sufferring of a single person. In Hell, there is always room
enough. In the center of each room, a mortal is suspended by
his entrails from a series of gruesome hooks in the ceiling, which
is crawling with all manner of worms. The worms are on the ceiling, 
and the disembowelled mortal hangs below in agony; gravity
does the rest. 
[Exits: north east south west] 

The Hell of Being Burned Alive
  Of all the horrible scenes in this plane, this place most closely
fits the classical definition of Hell. It is a cracked, ash-smelling
plane stretching infinitely in every direction. Lakes of fire
and lava dot the landscape as far as the eye can see, and horned
devils torture countless damned mortals, forcing them to drink molten
lead, pressing them under flaming stones...any number of excrutiating
torments are here.
Portals lead off in the cardinal directions. 
[Exits: north east south west]

The Hell of a Ten Thousand Knives
  This place only holds a single damned mortal at a time, a special
place of torment. No particular status is necessary, damned souls
are put here on a demon lords whim. This is actually a small,
enclosed chamber, looking to have been constructed of cinderblock.
In the center, you see some poor wretch of a man, his body suspended
in mid-air by thousands upon thousands of tiny, metal wires, all piercing
straight through him in every direction, through every inch of his body.
Any motion on his part causes the wires to cut him, inside and out. The
poor soul can't even afford to scream...
Portals lead off in the cardinal directions.
[Exits: north east south west]

The Hell of Being Skinned Alive
  This place appears as to be a series of interlocking chambers,
each one holding a poor unfortunate mortal under the care of
a uniquely twisted demon. The screams hear are ever-present,
as each mortal has the flesh flayed from his bones eternally,
by claws, whips, wire...anyway the demons please.

Introduction: A Warning
You who have sold your souls.. the price is due, here, now.
This is the tome of the Underworld, a tome containing the power
of the Demons. Thera cannot contain these creatures, as it is
a weak, worthless land.. the introduction of such creatures could
very well destroy it.
Excellent.
Read on, members of the Brethren. Your truth is detailed within:
the demonblood flows from your hands, an unholy pact your food,
demonic cries your drink. Only attempt the conjuration of a demon
within your power.. for such summonings create a two-way portal,
one through which you may easily be consumed.
Nothing can stop us now - the Pact is sealed.
                    - The Brethren -
                Rungekutta and Rantialen

look lesser
The Dretch is a a lesser demon, those of the lower ranks of the
Brethren may find it useful. Those below rank twenty would be
fools to attempt such a conjuration, fools, or those with a wish
to die.
It is a slave of the Underworld - bound to servitute. It fights
with ferocity, but it is weak, stupid.. fodder. Use it to spread
the darkness, dwell not upon it. It is not worth your time.

look blood
The Mezzoloth are not worthless, but no powerful foe, if dealt
with correctly. However, they can make useful allies.. though
impractical, for those with access to demons of greater power.
Those below rank twenty five should not attempt such a
conjuration, lest they wish to meet their doom.

look pain
The transition between the lesser and intermediate demons is
the Tengu. A beast of cunning, it holds little regard for its
foes, believing itself beyond their means. It, however, is not
known for its great intellect - only undying belief that its
feathery body will withstand any torment.
Those below rank thirty would be wise to leave this beast be.

look angst
The more powerful version of the Tengu, its foolish pride is
coupled with a bit more power, making the pride not so foolish.
This demon is not considered a "lesser" demon any longer, it
is of the intermediate. Summoners below rank thirty five deserve
the death rewarded, if they should be so stupid as to attempt
to bind a tengwar to themselves.

look terror
The cthul - heh - a demon not quite undead, but desiring the
undeath like nothing else. Not quite living.. not quite dead,
this creature offers itself to service to only the most worthy
master. A valuable ally, as it is said that it will proctect
until death.. it does not matter whose. This demon is one that
should be conjured after the fortieth rank, and not before.

look destruction
On the verge of a greater demon, the Cthulahdd is an intermediate
demon with aspirations. It has been called a death eater, a soul
drinker, and the predator. Upon the lowest planes, the dretch
run from it, or are slain almost instantly. Its power grows in
death, a binding to such a creature is always risky.. but, if
successful, a risk one is willing to take. One of the forty-fifth
rank would be wise to gain it as an ally.. one of an earlier rank
would be fool to disturb its slumber.

look contempt
The greater demons are few, but among them is the Balrog.
Its ferocity is rarely equaled, and through sheer will it is
able to overcome even the most powerful of foes. It is feared
by the scum of the Underworld. It does not accept defeat, nor
does it easily accept binding. If you are of sufficient power to
gain an slave such as the Balrog, consider yourself one of few.
No attempts to capture the Balrog should be made before the
fiftieth rank in this accursed realm.

look death
When a mortal speaks the word "violence," they do not understand
of what they speak. Until they have witnessed the Klahgaht, that is.
The greater demons are constantly warring, for they thrive on death,
and abhor peace. The Klahgaht is no exception, as master, as slave..
it matters not. Let the blood flow.
Woe to the fool that would challenge violence itself, say I. This is
the final demon a mortal should consider summoning, lest they risk
a grand sacrifice for their power. This beast is the hero's pursuit,
and should be left only to those who have gained their final ranks.

look wyrm
The unholy spawn of Dragon and Demon, a mutation resulting in power
beyond wildest comprehension. A dragon, befouled by lesser, demonic,
blood.. yet its power suggests its true heritage. No other demon equals
the power of the Dragkagh, and no mortal can stand to its power.
Upon conjuration, however, this demon is more likely to annihilate you
than you are to contain it. It considers you worthless, scum, waste..
prove to it that you are not, and you have a slave of epic proportion.
Utter its name, mortal, and your life hangs in the balance.
